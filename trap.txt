The Faroe Islands

	 	Trap Færøerne.

Licens: Begrænset anvendelse In the northern Atlantic Ocean between Iceland and Norway lie 18 verdant islands that together make up the Faroe Islands. The five largest islands are Streymoy, Vágar, Eysturoy, Sandoy and Suðuroy, and the smallest is the uninhabited Lítla Dímun. The Faroe Islands’ capital is Tórshavn, where 13,628 people out of the Faroe Islands’ total population of 52,896 live. There are currently 29 municipalities, several of which only have very few inhabitants.

The formation of the Faroe Islands began 61 million years ago in connection with the violent volcanic activity that occurred during the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea. However, it is the ice ages that over the past two million years have formed the current archipelago.

The northern and remote location has meant that the wildlife and plant life on land is quite poor in species. Whereas particularly mosses, but also many insects have immigrated to the islands on their own, other animals and plants have arrived with the help of humans, such as the house mouse and the mountain hare. There is an abundant bird life, which includes Atlantic puffin, northern fulmar and the national bird the oystercatcher. Three islands, Nólsoy, Skúvoy and Mykines, have been designated Ramsar sites to protect bird life.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 Tourism has grown in the Faroe Islands and every year, many large cruise ships call at Tórshavn and some other ports for a short stays.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 However, the greatest wildlife is found in the seas with large fish populations of cod and blue whiting, grey seals and whales, including long-finned pilot whales, of which between 500 and 1,500 end up on the dinner tables every year after being driven into the fjords. Historically and culturally, the hunting for long-finned pilot whale is a major event in the Faroe Islands. The fishing industry is extensive and accounts for about 90 % of the Faroe Islands’ exports. Dried cod was among the first ways to process and preserve the catch. Later, especially after World War II, exports mainly consisted of fresh and filleted fish. Some 50 years ago, salmon farming started, and today, the Faroe Islands are the world’s fifth largest producer of salmon.

The first signs of human activity in the Faroe Islands were found at the village of Sandur on Sandoy and date from the 4th-6th century. Irish monks came to the islands in the 7th-8th century. However, it was after the arrival of the Vikings that the islands became part of Norway, which made them a Norwegian tax territory in 1035. According to tradition, Christianity was introduced by the legendary hero Sigmundur Brestisson in 999, and, in the 12th century, an episcopal residence was established in Kirkjubøur. The current parish church served as a cathedral until the end of the 13th century, at which point the construction of a much grander Gothic cathedral in the same area began. Today, the only the ruins remain of the Magnus Cathedral.

The Faroese Parliament, the Løgting, which initially met in the open on Tinganes in Tórshavn, first convened in the first half of the 14th century. With the Reformation in 1540, the church’s land possessions passed to the crown, and in the 17th century trade was largely controlled from Copenhagen, and from 1709, directly by the king. In 1814, Denmark lost Norway, but kept the Faroe Islands, and the Løgting was abolished. However, it was re-established as a county council in 1852, four years later, free trade was introduced, and the fisheries experienced growth and higher exports. The population increased significantly during this period, as did the number of municipalities.

Free trade and growth contributed to increased Faroese consciousness and to discussions about independence versus unity with Denmark. However, with World War II, the Faroe Islands were occupied by Great Britain while Denmark was occupied by Germany. Up to 8,000 British soldiers built roads on the islands and a military airport, which became the foundation for today’s civilian Vágar Airport. The Home Rule Act was adopted in 1948, enabling the Løgting to take over e.g. taxes, healthcare, public welfare, schooling and municipal matters. The Faroese flag was recognised and the main language became Faroese.

The relationship between Denmark and the Faroe Islands was one of several elements involved in the Klaksvík conflict in the period 1952‑56, when Danish marines and police officers were sent to Klaksvík to create stability in a rebellious situation. The mission was successful, however, it increased the desire for secession. Construction of tunnels began in the 1960s, which intensified from 1970 and created completely new connections between the islands.

During the deep economic crisis that started in 1992, the Faroe Islands were put under Danish administration, which again caused serious cracks in the relationship. In the 1998 general election, the independence parties won a majority, which led to negotiations with Denmark, which, however, collapsed. The Government of the Faroe Islands then decided on its own to reduce the subsidies from Denmark. The wish for independence and having its own constitution often becomes topical when the independence parties are part of the Faroese government coalition.

Today, the Faroe Islands have an extensive infrastructure with roads, bridges and tunnels, including undersea tunnels. This means that there is relatively easy access to Tórshavn, which has been the islands’ most important trading stations since ancient times and continues to be the country’s capital. However, population growth has not only been concentrated in the capital area, but also in a more fragmented urbanisation, where islands, towns and villages have been linked together by the massive infrastructural investments. This allows for mobility in working life. The Faroese have often worked outside the Faroe Islands for periods of time, and the country is now experiencing increasing net immigration, tourism is picking up, and more restaurants, cultural initiatives and creative industries are seeing the light of day.

Legends, tales and traditions still play an important role in Faroese culture. One example is chain dancing, which is part of the curriculum in primary school. Rowing competitions are an important part of village summer gatherings, and, each year, the final is held at the national festival ólavsøka in Tórshavn where there are also processions and community singing. But new initiatives are also being introduced. Since 2012, an LGBT Pride parade has been held in connection with the celebrations. The old tradition of knitting has been refined into modern designs, some of which have become international hits. Old and new trends also mix in the visual arts where particularly the light and the landscape are central features. And the great focus that the public authorities have had on art in the public space has resulted in art being found almost everywhere in the Faroe Islands. Even below ground in the form of Tróndur Patursson’s decoration of the undersea roundabout in the Eysturoy Tunnel from 2020. National fiction writers include William Heinesen, whose imaginative novels have reached far beyond the country’s borders, but also new voices such as Lív Maria Róadóttir Jæger, who consciously experiments with genres.





Meaning of the name


The name is known from sometime in the 13th century where it appears in the forms Fęreygium and Færøyum. In later sources, it is found as Færøyium (1298), Færeyjar (1360‑80) and Færeyia (1399). In a Danish language context, the name appears in the 15th century as Fførøum (1412) and Ferøyr (1447). In modern Faroese, the islands are called Føroyar. The name is a combination of two words, where the suffix is the plural form of the West Norse noun oy, meaning ‘island’. The prefix has traditionally been interpreted as a West Norse noun fær ‘sheep’, an interpretation that can be traced back to a Norwegian manuscript from the 15th century, where the name is translated into Latin as insulæ ovium ‘the sheep islands’, which the author explains by saying that there are thousands of fat sheep on the islands.

The Irish monk Dicuil, who around 825 described how the islands’ oldest population immigrated from Ireland had now been driven out by the Normans, also tells how the islands were ‘brimming with sheep’; Unfortunately, he does not give the name of the islands. However, at the end of the Middle Ages, this interpretation was questioned, since fær was then no longer known as a West Norse term for sheep, which in Faroese is called seyður (Norwegian sau, from West Norse sauðr). However, later studies seem to have proven that both terms existed concurrently in the early Middle Ages, and that Færøy is known as a common island name in Norway, with most likely a similar meaning. The critics of the sheep interpretation have instead suggested the Gaelic noun fearann ‘land’, which would then relate to the Celtic past of the islands, and although this word should probably be rejected as a possible prefix for linguistic reasons, it cannot formally be ruled out that the prefix is indeed a West Norse translation or a garbled form of an unknown Gaelic name for the islands.





Coat of arms


The coat of arms of the Faroe Islands. The coat of arms of the Faroe Islands is a ram and is known from a carving on a church chair from Kirkjubøur dated 1406‑42. The coat of arms is also known from the seal of the old Faroese court. An impression of the seal is known from 1533, but the seal is likely from the 14th century. In 1666, the coat of arms of the Faroe Islands was included in the range of arms included in the Danish royal coat of arms, and was permanently included in the royal coat of arms from 1819. The coat of arms is also used by the Government of the Faroe Islands.

The coat of arms is possibly very literal, as the name of the Faroe Islands may derive from the Old Norse word for sheep.

Merkið, the Faroese flag


Merkið, the Faroese flag. The flag of the Faroe Islands is white with a red cross with blue edges. The flag is called Merkið, which means ‘the banner’ in Faroese. Designed in 1919, the flag became official in 1940/1948.

Merkið is a Nordic cross flag, which means that it belongs to a group of flags inspired by the Dannebrog and characterised by the centre of the cross being offset towards the flagpole. The design and choice of colours make you think of the Norwegian flag and the strong historical and cultural ties between the Faroe Islands and Norway.

The flag was created by Faroese students in Copenhagen in 1919. One of them, Jens Oliver Lisberg (1896‑1920), was the first to raise the flag in the Faroe Islands on 22 June 1919 in his home village of Fámjin on Suðurøy. Today, the original flag hangs in Fámjin Kirkja.

The Faroese flag became widely used in the 1930s. This led to conflicts within the country and with the Danish authorities, who maintained that ships native to the Faroe Islands should sail under the Danish flag.

Denmark was occupied by Germany on 9 April 1940, and a few days later, the British occupied the Faroe Islands. The Faroese fishing fleet was essential for the supply of fish to Great Britain, and in order to avoid confusion with vessels from German-occupied Denmark, the British officially recognised the Faroese flag as a nationality mark on all Faroese ships on 25 April 1940. A date that is now celebrated as Faroese Flag Day.

With the introduction of home rule in the Faroe Islands in 1948, the Faroese flag was also recognised by Denmark. The flag design received formal royal approval, and it became legal for everyone in the Kingdom of Denmark to use the Faroese flag without special permission.

The Faroese flag is closely associated with everything Faroese. As a national symbol, it is used in official contexts by the Faroese Government and on all ships registered in the Faroe Islands. Both in the Faroe Islands and among Faroese in Denmark and all over the world, the flag is widely flown in connection with national holidays, sporting events and private parties.

The flag design and use is regulated by a Løgting act from 1959, as amended in 1998. An executive order from 2003 sets out a number of official flag days on which flags are flown from government buildings. The central authorities of the Realm in the Faroe Islands, including the High Commissioner of the Faroe Islands, the court in the Faroe Islands, the defence and the police, use the Dannebrog as a split flag.





Nature and landscape


A small flock of Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) on the grassy coastal slopes of Mykines; easily recognisable by their brightly coloured beak, which has earned them the nickname ‘sea parrot’. The iconic bird from the auk family spends its life at sea but comes to the Faroe Islands in March-April to bring the next generation into the world. They have been vital to the birding activities on the islands, and in 1939 the total catch of Atlantic puffin in the Faroe Islands was estimated at 200,000 birds per year.

OLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2008 The island of Mykineshólmur is the Faroe Islands’ westernmost point connected to the mainland. The first bridge over the Holmgjógv gorge was built in 1909 and has since been replaced. The 40 m long bridge, which can only be used by pedestrians, was built in connection with the establishment of the lighthouse on Mykineshólmur.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2009 Like 18 steep and green islands, the Faroe Islands rise out of the North Atlantic roughly halfway between Iceland and Norway. The surrounding ocean and the warm North Atlantic Current mean that the Faroe Islands have a relatively mild climate, which, together with the rich resources in the ocean, have played a decisive role for settlement and the utilisation of the natural resources, which have impacted the way of life, self-perception and economy of the Faroese until today.

The formation of the Faroe Islands began ca. 61 million years ago with the opening of the North Atlantic and the accompanying violent volcanic activity. However, it was not until the ice ages that the country emerged as an archipelago. Ice, water and wind eroded down through the basalt plain created by the volcanoes, breaking it into islands, islets and skerries. The Faroe Islands are thus the remains of a degraded basalt plain, and the many alternating layers of basalt and sediments exposed by the erosion bear witness to countless, extremely violent volcanic eruptions, only interrupted by short periods of calm.

Together with the latitude, the modest size of the islands and their isolated location mean that plant life and wildlife on land is poor in species. The first plants immigrated at the end of the last Ice Age. Over the subsequent some 11,000 years, plant life has changed together with changing climatic conditions, while the later human immigration and the many grazing sheep have had the greatest impact on plant life. As of now, 843 different plant species have been registered on the islands, the vast majority of which are mosses and angiosperms.

Among the animals, it is especially the birds that characterise the islands. Even though many species have declined considerably, you can still see breeding northern fulmars, Atlantic puffins, storm petrels, black-legged kittiwakes, shearwaters and common guillemots in their thousands. Large flocks of starlings appear in towns and villages, while infields and outfields serve as breeding grounds for various wading birds, including the oystercatcher, which is the national bird of the Faroe Islands.

There are no indigenous land mammals in the Faroe Islands, but when humans arrived on the islands, they not only brought domestic animals, they also brought the house mouse as a blind passenger. Later, the brown rat came to the islands. In the mid-19th century, Norwegian mountain hares were released at Tórshavn and can now be found on several of the islands.

Many of the invertebrates were also introduced by humans. This applies to the New Zealand flatworm, common wasp and white-tailed bumblebee. However, there are also a number of species which have apparently found their way to the North Atlantic islands themselves. Lake flies and caddisflies can be seen above the lakes and streams where their larvae grow, and in the outfield, you can come across the violet ground beetle and find the froghoppers ‘cuckoo spit’ on the yellow marsh-marigold.

However, the richest wildlife and plant life can be found in the surrounding ocean. The Faroese waters are home to large fish populations, many of which are of enormous commercial importance. Some fish species stay around the islands for most of their lives, while others pass them on their migrations to and from the spawning grounds. The latter includes blue whiting, of which, on average, around 400,000 tonnes are caught from Faroese waters each year. Cod is also important for commercial fishing, and particularly the cod from the Faroe Bank is notable for its very rapid growth.

Whales are a common sight, and up until 1984, periodic large-scale whaling was common in the Faroe Islands. However, it is mainly the catches of long-finned pilot whale that have caught the attention of the world. The hunting of pilot whales has probably taken place since the Viking Age and remains an important social and cultural event. The longfinned pilot whale is one of the most abundant whale species in the North Atlantic and passes the Faroe Islands in large and small pods mainly in late summer. During the hunting, longfinned pilot whales are driven into certain fjords where they are killed and their meat is distributed. Within the past 100 years, 500‑1,500 whales have been caught each year.

These days, vulnerable nature and the environment are threatened by, for instance, climate change, invasive species, microplastics and various environmentally harmful substances, the effects of which we have probably only just seen the beginning. Environmental and nature management is under Faroese jurisdiction and includes monitoring, regulation and requirements for approval of activities that may impact nature and the environment. In addition, three areas of special natural value have been listed, while the islands of Nólsoy, Skúvoy and Mykines have been designated as Ramsar sites due to their remarkable birdlife.

History


Ring from Velbastaður in gold-plated silver, decorated with the Christian symbols grapes and a cross. It was found in connection with the study of the village’s small church ruin with a round cemetery. The ring dates to the late Viking Age or early Middle Ages.

FINNUR JUSTINUSSEN, 2016 In prehistoric times, the Faroe Islands remained uninhabited for a long time, the first traces of human presence only being known from 300‑500 AD. Irish monks reportedly came to the islands in the 7th and 8th centuries, but it was not until the Viking Age with people from Norway that actual colonisation took place. According to tradition, Christianity was introduced in 999, and in the 12th century a Faroese episcopal residence was established in Kirkjubøur.

From around 1035, the Faroe Islands became a tax area under Norway and came under Norwegian jurisdiction. However, the number of inhabitants on the islands was still limited; the population around the year 1300 is estimated at 2,440.

For a long time, it was believed that the Magnus Cathedral had never been completed and that the unfinished building fell into ruin. However, recent investigations indicate that the church construction was completed, that the church had a roof, doors and windows and was consecrated as a cathedral, and that it was in use until the Reformation and then fell into disrepair.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 Today, the headquarters of the Faroese Government are located on Tinganes in Tórshavn, with the Prime Minister’s office at the far end of the headland. However, until 1856, the Royal Faroese Trade Monopoly was based in these historic buildings.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 With the Reformation in 1540, the land of the church passed to the crown, which subsequently granted the land to the King’s yeomen. During the 17th century, ties to Norway weakened; trade with the islands was now managed from Copenhagen, and the king appointed a Danish lawman. Danes Christoffer and Frederik Gabel, father and son, were vassals on the islands in the period 1655‑1708 and were also given charge of trade. Their attempts at restructuring the trade resulted in great discontent among the Faroese. The king took over the trade in the Faroe Islands in 1709.

Several changes happened in the Faroe Islands’ situation in the first half of the 19th century. Although Denmark lost Norway in 1814, the kingdom retained absolute control over the Faroe Islands. In 1821, the islands were given the status of Faroe County, and in 1852, the Løgting (the national parliament) was restored after it had been abolished in 1816. Following major losses, the royal monopoly trade was abolished in 1856 and replaced by free trade. At the same time, the islands experienced growth in the population, which around 1850 came close to 8,500.

From the second half of the 19th century, the number of municipalities increased sharply. Whereas, previously there was only one, in 1920, the number was 33, and this trend continued and peaked in 1970 with 51 municipalities. At the same time, the population grew: In 1920, the population had reached around 20,000, and in 1970 it was around 38,000.

Changes also took place within occupations with lasting impact on Faroese society. The fishing industry experienced strong growth, and fishery products became the predominant export item. Consequently, the population concentrated at natural harbours where fish products could be processed.

A greater awareness of Faroese identity emerged from the end of the 19th century, and an increased political awareness led to the formation of Faroese parties. The pivotal political point of contention which would characterise the political discussion in posterity, was the question of unity or home rule in relation to Denmark.

The world crisis in 1929 hit the Faroese economy hard, however, World War II, when the Faroe Islands were occupied by the British, had a positive impact as the Faroese fishing fleet supplied the English market.

The Home Rule Act was passed in 1948, which meant that the home rule government took over a number of policy areas. The law introduced the Government of the Faroe Islands, which was appointed by the Løgting. In the following decades, requests were made to take over more and more areas, which included the welfare area. This required an expansion of the administrative apparatus in the Faroe Islands.

In the years 1952‑56, a doctor’s conflict took place, the so-called Klaksvík controversy, which contained several different dimensions, including local topics and discussions about the relationship between Denmark and the Faroe Islands. The dispute led to Danish warships with marines and police officers being sent to Klaksvík. Eventually the unrest was stopped, but the conflict helped strengthen the desire for secession.

The infrastructure was expanded from the first half of the 20th century, first with roads and from the 1960s also with tunnels. At the same time, port facilities were expanded and modernised. Especially since 1970, there has been a real revolution in the links between the islands with bridges and tunnels, including the first underground tunnel in 2002.

In 1992, the Faroe Islands went through a serious economic crisis with several bankruptcies, which resulted in the Faroe Islands effectively being put under administration and having to take out loans in Denmark. The fishing industry was threatened, the banks were in crisis, unemployment rose and wages dropped. The crisis also led to serious challenges in the relationship between Denmark and the Faroe Islands. At the beginning of the 2000s, the political debate calmed down and the Faroese economy came back on its feet again.

Culture


Men, women and children in national costumes at ólavsøka on 28 July 2018.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN Legends, tales and traditions still play a key role in Faroese culture, but a wide range of arts is seeing breakaway from tradition and a desire for renewal and experimenting with new forms and trends with a more global outlook. Cultural expressions can also foster debate, for example in relation to how they are affected by the growing tourism and perhaps should be adapted to new contexts.

Pilot whale hunt near Tórshavn in May 2019. A pod of pilot whales is driven onto the beach by the locals, as has been the practice on the islands for centuries.

MARTIN N. JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX Faroese chain dancing is a tradition that can be traced back to the Middle Ages. The dancing is not accompanied by instruments, but ballads are sung while the participants dance. Today, chain dancing is a compulsory subject in primary school, and it is included in the inventory of intangible cultural heritage of the Faroe Islands.

Rowing, which is considered the national sport of the Faroe Islands, is also an old tradition that is maintained and forms part of the village summer meetings. The final of the Faroe Islands rowing championships is held in Tórshavn in connection with the national festival ólavsøka on 28‑29 July, which is celebrated with various elements such as a procession and community singing. In the world of sports, football has also gained widespread popularity.

Within visual arts and crafts, it is clear to see how old and new trends meet. Nature and landscape as themes have always been represented in the visual arts, but now ecocritical themes are also brought up. Handicrafts are characterised by local products such as wool, skins and horns as well as a commitment to sustainability. Knitting is an old tradition. While other countries have seen a decline in the mastery of hand knitting, it has been maintained in the Faroe Islands. The craft has been professionalised, and several designers have achieved international success.

Art in the public space is becoming widespread. One of the latest works of art is Tróndur Patursson’s decoration in connection with the establishment of the undersea roundabout in the Eysturoy Tunnel inaugurated in 2020.

For centuries, the Faroese building style was characterised by a certain uniformity with buildings made of wood and with turf roofs, but from the second half of the 20th century, new types of houses have appeared. A growing population from around the year 2000 has led to a need for new housing, which now comes in many shapes and sizes.

In the past, the church was often the largest house in the village. The original building material was wood, but later stone and concrete was also used. The church buildings in the episcopal residence of Kirkjubøur, which date back to the Middle Ages, show contacts with the rest of Europe at the time. The oldest of the buildings is still being used as a parish church.

Literature has been greatly influenced by the transition from Danish to Faroese as the language of instruction, and we talk about a Danish-language, a bilingual and a monolingual/Faroese-language period in the history of Faroese literature. Literature has been an arena for developing and raising the awareness of the national identity and consciousness. The great and internationally acclaimed authors include William Heinesen, who wrote in Danish during this specific period of change. Characteristically, his works were not really read in the Faroe Islands until after some of them had been translated in the 1970s.

Since the end of the 19th century, fishing has been the Faroese’s most important means of livelihood, but it has now been overtaken by salmon farming. Salmon farming is a relatively new industry in the Faroe Islands, but the favourable conditions and high prices have given farming a boost.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 A mobile farm operated by the new large wellship Hans á Bakka built in Turkey and commissioned in 2015.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 The political system has its roots in 1906, when the first Faroese parties emerged. It was the relationship with Denmark which caused the division, and since then, a party system has developed which, under home rule, has been expanded into a two-dimensional party system, where the political parties need to deal with a unityindependence axis and a right wingleft wing axis. Furthermore, there is a centre-periphery axis that cuts across the political parties, and in recent decades a further dividing line between a value-conservative and a value-liberal wing has been established.

In 2018, all youth education programs in Tórshavn were merged into Glasir – Tórshavn College, which has over 1,500 students and 250 employees. Glasir moved into a new shared building designed by the architectural firm BIG – Bjarke Ingels Group. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2022 Since the transformation of Faroese society from a farming community to a fishing community during the 19th century, about 90 % of Faroese exports have been fish products; first dried and salted fish for the southern European markets, since World War II more fresh fish and in recent times, salmon farming has played an increasing role. The export markets are the EU, the USA and the UK, as well as in recent years China and Russia.

The Faroese labour market is flexible. Traditionally, surplus Faroese labour in times of crisis has travelled to other countries to find work, and this still characterises the Faroese workforce. In particular, the Danish labour market has been easily accessible to Faroese in times of crisis in the Faroe Islands, but even in good times, many Faroese have found work outside the country. In the Faroe Islands, a well-developed network of roads and tunnels connects the 18 islands. As a result, in 2020, about 90 % of the population, of which about 40 % live in Tórshavn, would have to travel a maximum of two hours by car or bus to meet, independently of ferries. Apart from the roughly 5,000 inhabitants on Suðuroy, which is the only large island without a direct road connection to the capital area, most of the country’s inhabitants can settle wherever they want and still be able to commute to work every day.

Since the 1950s, the health and welfare sector has been developed according to the Scandinavian model with financial support from Denmark. The challenges in this area, such as welfare diseases and demographic changes with an increasingly aging population, are similar to those of other modern welfare societies, but in the Faroe Islands birth rates are still higher than in several other western welfare societies. The administrative part of the primary school was taken over by the home rule in the 1970s, in the same way as the hospital and welfare area, while the financial and legislative part was not taken over until 2002.

As a result of the plans to allocate more areas to the municipalities, the possibilities of reducing the number of the often very small municipalities with poor resources are being looked into. Despite prevailing popular opposition, a number of municipal amalgamations have taken place, and a number of inter-municipal collaborations have emerged. In the school, education and research area, institutions were established in all relevant areas during the 20th century. Since the early 2000s the system has included education and research at all levels as well as relevant research at a Faroese university and sector institutions at international level.

The great economic crisis of the 1990s caused political turbulence and major changes that had a long-lasting impact on society in virtually all areas, with widespread unemployment and massive emigration. The economic and social recovery took place in a remarkably short time in the period 1992‑96, but demographically it was a disaster that took 20 years to overcome. It was bound to have consequences. A Faroese unemployment fund was established in 1992, and the evaluation of the crisis itself led to a fundamental change in economic policy. At the same time, the political system and administration were reformed with the introduction of negative parliamentarism and ministerial accountability. In the aftermath followed a greater desire for independence in the population, and politically this became clear in the general election in 1998, when the independence parties won a majority. In the year 2000, the new government coalition initiated negotiations with the government on the issue. The negotiations broke down with the consequence that the Faroese Government unilaterally decided to reduce the financial support from Denmark by a third; the matter of a Faroese constitution, which is an offshoot of the negotiations, has since been relevant in Faroese politics during the periods when the independence wing is part of the government coalition.

However, Faroese politics is in particular dominated by social and redistributive political issues, also between the geographical areas. The centreperiphery and right-left axes are thus dominant during an economic boom on the islands, while the unity-independence axis has been subordinate in the previous decade.

The islands, towns and villages


Map of districts and municipalities.

KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 A markatal settlement, also simply called a village, has been a geographical and production unit since ancient times. It is estimated according to an old land measurement for a specific markatal. A mørk (mark, plural: merkur) is 16 gyllin, and 1 gyllin is 20 skinn. The total land is estimated at 2,367 merkur, 6 gyllin and 16 skinn distributed over 85 markatal settlements. Of these, 1,285 merkur, 8 gyllin and 13 skinn are copyhold land, which today also includes the socalled endowed land that formerly belonged to the vicarages. 1,081 merkur, 14 gyllin and 3 skinn are freehold land or privately owned land. The markatal settlements still form the basis for all land registration in the Faroe Islands. The age of the oldest villages is traditionally affirmed by referring to Hundabrævið (the Dog Letter). This letter was written between 1350 and 1400 from the lawman and members of the old Faroese court with a regulation on how many sheepdogs there should be in certain named villages.

Tórshavn waterfront. In the centre foreground is the schooner Nordlyset, which was built as a fishing vessel in 1945. In the years 1985‑89 it was renovated and has since been used for charter trips and cruises in the Faroe Islands. On the left is Hotel Tórshavn which was formerly the town’s seamen’s home.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 The difference between freehold land and copyhold land is that freehold land, like any other private property, can be both inherited and sold. The copyhold land belonged to the king, and the royal farms were leased – that is granted as copyhold – by royal farmers against a small fee. As a rule, the eldest son took over the farm from his father. Since the royal land became copyhold land after the introduction of home rule, the copyhold rules have become more flexible. The vicars had their farms from the so-called endowed land, which was a form of copyhold land and was part of their salary. As the vicars began to be remunerated in money, the endowed land became copyhold land that others could lease. In the past, some of the land also belonged to the noble families of the kingdom, but it was later acquired by private individuals and thus became part of the freehold land.

Normally a field includes both bøur (infield) and hagi (outfield) as well as beach rights and rights to catch on bird cliffs, etc., but sometimes the designation can include either an infield or an outfield alone. The infield is the cultivated land that surrounds the village, while the outfield is the uncultivated grazing areas in the mountains outside the infield. The infield is distributed between the individual owners and could before the replacement from the mid-1900s be very scattered. The outfield has long been communal property, but in recent times, it has also been replaced to a certain extent.

When the population grew during the 19th century, more land was not only cultivated in the old villages by expanding the infield within the old framework, new enclaves were also cultivated in the outfield, called gerði. So-called traðir (cultivated plots of land) were also cultivated. This led to the emergence of several niðursetubygdir (outlying villages) within the territorial boundaries of the individual markatal settlements. In terms of markatal, they still belong to the old village, but the infield acquired a special status, which comes with the term trøð, which originally meant a fenced cultivated plot of land in the outfield. A de-matriculated trøð could be leased and often later bought when it had been fully or partially cultivated. It then became private property. The cultivated plots of land were also common in the old villages. The outlying villages emerged within the framework of the old village communities as a supplement to the markatal settlement, and some of them eventually developed into large important villages after fishing became the primary occupation. This applies to Tvøroyri and later also to Runavík.

The markatal settlements are thus old economic and production units, in which the Faroese village identity is still emotionally rooted in many cases, and today the markatal is most relevant in connection with sheep farming. The outlying villages have gradually also developed their own identity and have given names to some of the largest municipalities.

From the old days, large villages could consist of scattered small býlingar (neighbourhoods). In many villages, these býlingar have gradually grown into coherent wholes, but in some villages they are still visible.

Until the introduction of rural municipalities in 1872, no other local right of disposal existed than that it was the people who managed the land in the markatal settlements, who through this also decided most things in the local communities. This took place at grannastevna (village or town gatherings), where the individual owner had something to say according to how much land he or she had at his or her disposal. The land was thus the structural basis of the local communities.

Districts, small parishes and superior parishes are concepts that can be traced back to the Middle Ages. A district is an administrative unit with various administrative tasks. There are currently six districts: Norðoya, Eysturoyar, Streymoyar, Vága, Sandoyar and Suðuroyar. In the past, each district had one sheriff, but the number of sheriffs has now been reduced to three, and some of the former the sheriffs’ tasks have now been taken over by other institutions. However, they still have police authority and carry out tasks in connection with the pilot whale catch and the distribution of the catch according to a special regulation. Small parishes in the Faroe Islands were, as in the rest of the Nordic region, related to the church. A superior parish is the term for a vicar’s official district, which included several small parishes that the vicar served and where he delivered the sermon in proper order. The number of superior parishes has changed over the years and has been divided into more parishes. In 2021, the number of superior parishes was 16, but the total number of vicars was higher.

In 1866, Tórshavn was established as an urban municipality, and when the rural municipalities were established, the old superior parishes were used as the organising principle. The number of municipalities has changed significantly over time, just as their areas of responsibility have changed. These areas included the management of schools in the villages from 1872 when compulsory schooling was finally introduced. Accordingly, the old public schools that had been in use 1846‑54, which was a period when experiments were made with compulsory schooling, were taken into use again, and new ones were built.

Argisbrekka


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur When the electricity company SEV had to dam Lake Eiðisvatn in 1986 as a water reservoir, it led to a major archaeological investigation of an area at Argisbrekka, where 22 small buildings made of turf were uncovered. Carbon 14 dating from the investigations shows that the shieling activity at Argisbrekka began during the 9th century and ended in the middle of the 11th century.

Shieling was part of the Landnam farming practices at this time, where, like in Norway, people stayed on the ærgi (mountain pasture) in the summer with the livestock.

Before Eiðisvatn was dammed in connection with the establishment of a hydropower the Norse settlements in Ireland and plant, archaeological remains of a shieling from the Viking Age were found on Argisbrekka. Since then, a study of sediments at the bottom of Eiðisvatn has dated the arrival of sheep and thus people to around the year 500.

Population trends on the Faroe Islands from 1327-2022


trap.fo



	 	 The first estimate of the Faroe Islands’ population is from the year 1300, when the population was estimated at 2,440. The next estimate is for 1327, when the number had risen to 2,700. In 1600, the population was estimated to be about 3,200. The following 50 years saw a decline in population, reaching a critical low of 2,515 in 1650. This is due to the unusually long cold period throughout Europe, referred to as ‘the Little Ice Age’, where living conditions on the Faroe Islands drastically worsened with cold winters and cool, rainy summers. In 1710, the population was about 3,600 people, and in 1720 it had increased to 3,985.

The first actual census in 1769 showed a population of 4,769, and by the next census in 1801, it had reached about 5,000. One reason for the increase in population was that the natural conditions had improved, but equally important was the fact that the propertyless now had access to allotments of land. At the same time, the fishing industry developed in the period leading up to the turn of the century, when the population tripled to about 15,000 in 1901. The development continued, and the census in 1950 showed a doubling to about 30,000 inhabitants.

The economic downturn in the early 1990s led to massive emigration, and it took 25 years to get back to pre-crisis levels. In 2022, society has been completely restored, and the population is 53,676.

The middle ages on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 This impressive 63 cm wide document contains certified copies of six letters written between 1403 and 1405 collected in a diploma recorded in 1407 in Tórshavn. These letters known as Húsavíkarbrøvini (the Húsavík Letters) are about one of the Faroe Islands’ richest women, Guðrun Sjúrðardóttir, and her hereditary estate. When the woman in Húsavík on Sandoy died in 1405, she left no heir to her properties in the Faroe Islands, Shetland and Norway. Today, the document is part of a collection of diplomas from the Norwegian kingdom (incl. the Faroe Islands, Shetland and the Orkney Islands) in The Arnamagnaean Manuscript Collection at the University of Copenhagen and bears the signature ‘AM Dipl. Norv. fasc.’.

SUZANNE REITZ/THE ARNAMAGNAEAN MANUSCRIPT COLLECTION, 2014 The Faroe Islands were most likely included together with the Norse communities on Shetland, the Orkney Islands, the Hebrides and Isle of Man in the Norwegian unification process around year 1100, when the leaders of the countries became vassals liable to pay taxes to the Norwegian king; in respect of the Faroe Islands, it is believed that the inclusion took place around 1035. These areas were also considered by the Church of Rome to be areas of Norwegian interest, and a diocese was established in the Faroe Islands around 1120. Together with the dioceses on Isle of Man and the Orkney Islands as well as in Iceland and Greenland, this diocese was placed under the new Norwegian archbishopric of Nidaros in Norway in 1152/53. Until its abolishment in 1557, the Faroese episcopal residence was in Kirkjubøur.

Ring from Velbastaður in gold-plated silver, decorated with the Christian symbols grapes and a cross. It was found in connection with the study of the village’s small church ruin with a round cemetery. The ring dates to the late Viking Age or early Middle Ages.

FINNUR JUSTINUSSEN, 2016 A stone church was built there in the 13th century; beneath it lies a former church. Around the year 1300, another church was built in Kirkjubøur, the much larger and more richly ornamented Magnus Cathedral, to replace the old cathedral. The Norwegian unification process entered its final stage in the 13th century. In the years 1261‑64, Greenland and Iceland became subordinate to the Kingdom of Norway as tributaries until 1380, when the Faroe Islands, together with Norway, Iceland and Greenland, became part of the Kingdom of Denmark. In 1271, the provincial law for the jurisdiction of the Gulating was implemented in the tributary of the Faroese Islands. Before 1280, however, the law was replaced by King Magnus Lagabøter’s Landslov (Norwegian Code of the Realm), which remained in force until Christian IV’s Norwegian Code from 1604, which is essentially a Danish translation of the Norwegian Code of the Realm. In 1688, medieval legislation was replaced by Christian V’s Norwegian Code. Magnus Lagabøter’s Landslov thus formed the framework for the political, legal and economic development of the Faroe Islands as a country in the Norwegian monarchical state during the High and Late Middle Ages and right up until absolute monarchy. The governing system in the Kingdom of Norway was characterised by collaboration between the State and local communities through representative courts or Lagting.

This reliquary can be found in the outer east wall of the Magnus Cathedral. It was carved from Norwegian soapstone in the early 14th century. The cavity behind it holds a lead box containing, for instance, bones that, according to the Latin text along the edges, stem from the saints Magnus and Thorlacius.

EMIL HELMS/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2021 The Faroese Løgting seems to have been established around 1350 and sat in Tórshavn. According to the law, the king or his ombudsman appointed the chief justice and the members of the old Faroese court, i.e. the judge and lay judges in the Løgting. The public prosecution as well as the collection of taxes and charges were handled by the king’s representative, whose ombudsmen in the local areas were called sheriffs and were locals. Their districts are called ‘sysler’, and the first time this division into districts is mentioned is around the year 1400.

With the royal legislation from the end of the 13th century, a state tax system was also introduced, which lasted until modern times. In addition, a land assessment system was introduced, which still forms the basis for the calculation of land value. Part of the agreement between the Faroese and the kingdom in 1271 was that the king had to ensure the transport of goods with two ships per year.

The fragmented source material from the 14th and 15th centuries suggests that the king farmed out the administration of the trade agreement and that both Norwegian merchants, the Hanseatic towns and later the Dutch were active in the trade. Similarly, the source material suggests that the royal government was managed by members of Norwegian noble families as feudal overlords, whose obligations in the country were handled by administrative officers. At the beginning of the 16th century, the Faroe Islands were a fief under Bergenhus Skanse, but in the period from 1529 to 1553, both the fief and trade were farmed out to merchants from Hamburg.

In terms of population, Faroese society was small in the High and Late Middle Ages. An assessment of the land and tax register from 1584 shows that there were about 305 taxable farms around the year 1300, against 427 in 1584. With an estimated average household size of approx. eight individuals, it totals some 2,440 inhabitants around the year 1300 and 3,426 in 1584. Tax was paid per household regardless of the size of the farms. In 1584, the state’s tax revenue from the Faroe Islands had a value of 331 guilders in Faroese goods. In terms of production value, it corresponded to about 14 kg of dry fish per household per year. In addition to taxes, the king’s income consisted of manorial dues, customs duties and fines.

The church also received payments from the population in the form of tithe, and, before the Reformation, also in the form of fines. The tithe was used to finance the bishopric, the churches, the vicars’ salaries and poor relief. In addition, before the Reformation, the church was responsible for the school system in the Faroe Islands. In the 14th and 15th century, the bishopric in Kirkjubøur underwent a major expansion with the construction of buildings that ended up as ruins already in the 17th century.

	 	 Ring from Velbastaður in gold-plated silver, decorated with the Christian symbols grapes and a cross. It was found in connection with the study of the village’s small church ruin with a round cemetery. The ring dates to the late Viking Age or early Middle Ages.

FINNUR JUSTINUSSEN, 2016 Archaeological and botanical studies indicate that there have been settlements in the Faroe Islands before the Norse settlement, which is known from the 9th century. The first traces of humans consist of some charred barley grains found in two patches of peat ash under a longhouse from the Viking Age at á Sondum in the village of Sandur on Sandoy. The excavation was carried out in 2006 and carbon 14 studies dated the grains in the lower patch to the period between the 4th and 6th centuries and in the upper patch to the period between the 6th and 8th centuries.

Ring-headed pin with valknut, a symbol associated with the Cult of Odin. This type was made in Dublin around the year 900. The discovery of the 150 mm long ring-headed pin at the burial site in Tjørnuvík in 1956 provided definitive archaeological proof of settlements during the Viking Age.

TJÓÐSAVNIÐ, NO YEAR In 2021, evidence was presented that humans lived in the Faroe Islands around 300 years before the arrival of the Vikings. The results are based on the study of sediments that have accumulated over millennia on the bottom of lake Eiðisvatn on Eysturoy. The sediments have been examined for ancient DNA from plants and animals as well as microscopic remains of faeces from, e.g., sheep. With the help of carbon 14 dating and tephrachronology (dating from the ash layers of known volcanic eruptions), a change in the vegetation, which may be due to grazing sheep, can be demonstrated around the year 500.

Other traces which may be connected to the early settlement are cultivated areas appearing as narrow strips of arable land separated by low, parallel, grassy embankments of stone and earth. They are found on south- and west-facing slopes, sometimes in fairly inaccessible terrain, such as in Akraberg and on Mykines.

TJÓÐSAVNIÐ, 2007 In 825, the Irish monk and geographer Dicuil wrote the work De mensura orbis terrae (Concerning the Measurement of the World). Based on an eyewitness account from a fellow Irish countryman, Dicuil, who worked in the Frankish kingdom, described an archipelago in the North Atlantic that matches with the Faroe Islands. According to him, these islands had been inhabited by Irish hermits, but were now abandoned due to pirate raids by the Norse. They were supposed to have lived on the islands for around 100 years. However, no archaeological traces have been found that can be linked to the hermits’ presence on the islands.

The viking age on the Faroe Islands

	 	Traces of an old village by the beach in the village of Sandur, which was excavated in the late 1980s.

SÍMUN V. ARGE, 2007 Written sources describing the earliest history of the Faroe Islands are few and far between. According to Færeyingasaga (Saga of the Faroe Islands), which was written by an Icelandic author in ca. 1215, the Norse settlement in the Faroe Islands took place in the 9th century in two stages. The saga tells that Grímur Kamban was the first, but that he was later joined by people fleeing King Harald Fairhair in Norway. Also, people who had a past in the Norse settlements in Ireland and the islands off Scotland came to the Faroe Islands. In this connection, the saga mentions the Icelandic landnam woman Auð the Deep-Minded, who had been married to a Viking king in the Norse settlement in Dublin. Studies of the genetic make-up of the Faroese population have shown that while the male settlers were predominantly of Scandinavian origin, the female settlers were predominantly from the British Isles. These studies therefore confirm the migration pattern described by Færeyingasaga.

Færeyingasaga also tells about the struggle for power between the two most powerful Faroese chieftain families in the period from around 960 to 1040, the Gøtuskeggja clan led by brothers Brestir and Beinir and the Hov clan, whose chieftain was Havgrímur í Hovi. The saga tells that Sigmundur, who was the son of Brestir and inherited the chieftainship of the two brothers, was a housecarl of King Olav Tryggvason of Norway, on whose behalf he introduced Christianity at the Faroese althing in 999. The saga also tells of the efforts of the Norwegian kings to incorporate the Faroe Islands into a Norwegian network kingdom in the North Atlantic, where the chieftains owed taxes to the Norwegian rulers, and that this succeeded under King Magnus the Good, when the heir to the two chieftainships, Leivur Øssursson, held the Faroe Islands in fief to the king.

The Icelandic saga’s account of the Faroes seems to be partly based on oral tradition from the Faroe Islands ca. year 1200, partly to be a literary creation with anachronisms. It should therefore be perceived rather as a representation of the society at that time in terms of legal relations and the relationship with the Norwegian Crown than as the historical reality of the Viking Age.

Ring-headed pin with valknut, a symbol associated with the Cult of Odin. This type was made in Dublin around the year 900. The discovery of the 150 mm long ring-headed pin at the burial site in Tjørnuvík in 1956 provided definitive archaeological proof of settlements during the Viking Age.

TJÓÐSAVNIÐ, NO YEAR. The archaeological remains from the Viking Age show that the population lived in longhouses of the type also seen in other North Atlantic societies of Norse origin during the Viking Age. The first archaeological investigations of a longhouse from the Viking Age was carried out in Kvívík in the 1940s and later also in Fuglafjørður and other villages. The first farms were typically built close to streams or by a beach with good access to the sea. Later in the Viking Age and in the Middle Ages, scattered farms (býlingar) were built on the edge of the infield of the original farm. These can still be seen in some villages, for example on the island of Koltur.

Reconstruction of the archaeologically excavated longhouse from approx. year 900 at Toftanes in Leirvík. In addition to the buildings, thousands of objects were found that shed light on daily life in the Viking Age. Some can be seen in the exhibition at Tjóðsavnið.

TJÓÐSAVNIÐ, 2007. The most extensive archaeological investigation of a farm from the Viking Age was carried out at Toftanes in Leirvík in the years 1982‑87. The farm, which is dated to the 10th century, consisted of an approx. 20 m long longhouse and three smaller buildings. The longhouse was built of thick curved walls of stone and peat around a wooden structure with benches along the walls inside the house and pairs of parallel roof-supporting posts. In the middle of the floor was a 5 m long stone hearth. The eastern part of the house was presumably a barn. Before the house was built, a system of stone-set drains or gutters were laid to keep the living area dry and perhaps also to supply the residents and livestock with running water indoors.

During the excavation of a burial ground in Tjørnuvík in 1957, a ringheaded pin was found placed at the chest of an adult woman. Carbon 14 dating of the skeleton and from another grave in the burial ground dated these to the 10th century. The location of the burial ground, the shape and orientation of the graves, as well as the grave goods and the motif on the ring-headed pin, a so-called valknut, link the burials to a pagan environment.

So far, no burial mounds from the Viking Age have been found, but names of certain localities are associated with graves and burial mounds such as Tormansgrøv in Vági, Havgrimsgrøv in Hovi and Øttisheyggur in Giljanes.

Objects bearing Christian symbols have been found from the time before Christianity was formally introduced in the Faroe Islands. Two small Christian wooden crosses from the 10th century have been found on the farm at Toftanes in Leirvík. There are small church ruins with surrounding circular cemetery walls, where the name element prayer house or cemetery is included in the place name, and which are reminiscent of similar church ruins and cemeteries from the Viking Age in Iceland and Greenland.

During recent investigations in the village of Velbastaður, a small church ruin was uncovered in a round cemetery from the Viking Age. Among the finds was a gilded finger ring, which is silver decorated with a cross and grapes. It can therefore be linked to a Christian environment in the late Viking Age or early Middle Ages. A rare English silver coin dated 910‑15 was also found in this cemetery. Carbon 14 dating of charred barley grains from the site has documented activity between 765 and 905. Remains of habitation can be seen on the slope facing the sea, indicating that some of the oldest buildings have been washed into the sea.

At Bønhúsfløta in Nes in Hvalba, parts of a presumed cemetery have been preserved, while the rest has been washed into the sea. On the slope within the cemetery wall, human bones have been found, which have been dated to the 11th century. A few meters from the cemetery wall are the ruins of a farm.

According to Færeyingasaga, the first church in the Faroe Islands was built on the island of Skúvoy. In connection with the reuse of an abandoned cemetery on Skúvoy, the workers came across coffin timber and some tombstones with carved wheel crosses and Latin crosses. Carbon 14 dating of the coffin timber shows that the cemetery was already in use in the 9th and 10th centuries and in the early Middle Ages. However, the origin and dating of the tombstones is much debated. Some researchers believe that the stones are Irish from the 7th-8th centuries, while others point out that similar crosses can be found in Norway and in the cemetery on Herjolfsnæs in Greenland where they date to the 13th century, and that the stones are therefore most likely from the early Christian Middle Ages. Other parallels can be found in the Hebrides. A fragment of a similar stone was later found on the beach on Skúvoy. It has a runic inscription interpreted as the names Gísli and Ísleifr and has been dated to around year 1000/1050‑1150.

On several of the islands, there are small ruins of vakhús (lookout houses), where watch was regularly kept for pirates. They served as part of a warning system so that the population could take shelter in the mountains when there were pirates in the waters.

In the outfield, there are several traces of human activities from different periods. The most visible are varðar (cairns or stacked cone-shaped dolmen) that still stand as signposts in a network of paths that connected farms and villages and led out to important places in the outfield. In addition, there are old fences or stone walls and smaller ruins as well as other traces of older land-use systems. Together with place names, these provide an understanding of past farming practices, such as sheep milking and pig farming.





Hoards, five churches and an insight into the daily life of the viking age in Sandur


Ring from Velbastaður in gold-plated silver, decorated with the Christian symbols grapes and a cross. It was found in connection with the study of the village’s small church ruin with a round cemetery. The ring dates to the late Viking Age or early Middle Ages.

FINNUR JUSTINUSSEN, 2016 The flat and open landscape of the village of Sandur on Sandoy with its fertile farmland has been an attractive area for the first farmers to arrive on the islands. Here, many years of archaeological investigations have uncovered rich and diverse ancient monuments.

In 1863, the, until now, only known Faroese hoard was found in the village’s cemetery. The local gravedigger came across a silver hoard lying in a rolled-up bundle containing a piece of a silver bracelet and 98 silver coins from Europe and Scandinavia from the period around 1000‑1100. Further investigations in 1972 showed that the hoard had been hidden under a floor made of large stone slabs in a large building that stood south of the church before the cemetery was established.

The tombstone with the Latin cross called Sigmundarsteinur stands in the cemetery in Skúvoy. It is named after chieftain Sigmundur Brestisson, who, according to the Færeyingasaga, built the country’s first church in that place.

SÍMUN V. ARGE, 2005 The current church dates from 1836 and is one of ten preserved traditional Faroese village churches made of wood. In 1969‑70, archaeological investigations under the church floor revealed that there had been five churches before. The first was a typical Scandinavian stave church from the 11th century with posts dug into the ground. In the later churches, the staves were set on foundation stones, and the interior woodwork was surrounded by protective stone and peat walls. The first two churches had a Romanesque floor plan with a square nave and a narrower choir to the east, while the later ones were rectangular and had a Gothic design.

In 1989, a burial ground with 11 graves was found just outside the cemetery wall. The dead had been given grave goods: rings of bronze and silver, necklaces with glass, amber and bone beads as well as jewellery, iron knives with handles wound with thin silver wire and a comb, presumably of bone. One of those buried had a wallet with lead weights at his belt, indicating that he was a merchant. A cut Kufic silver coin was also found, which has been dated to the 9th century.

In the 3,000 m² area, traces of buildings, extensive stone channels with large stone lids, ash, charred grain, slag and mounds of fire-brittled stones have also been found, which according to carbon 14 dating are from the early Viking Age. Traces of smithy activities and other craft activities from the Viking Age or the early Middle Ages have also been found in the area.

The related residential area is found in Junkarinsfløttur, which is approx. 100 m north of the church. Here, meter-thick culture layers and constructions from a settlement close to the eroding cliff have been uncovered. The settlement, which dates from the early Viking Age, was abandoned around the 13th century, and the move was apparently due to movements of the sand masses in the 13th-14th centuries. Studies provide an insight into the daily life and economy of the Faroese from the Viking Age to the High Middle Ages. Large amounts of well-preserved animal bones, fish bones and shells were found in the household waste. These came from mainly seabirds such as puffins, razorbills, common guillemots and black guillemots as well as many remains of cod, flatfish and shellfish. In addition, remains of sheep, cattle and pigs were found. Between Junkarinsfløttur and the church, the remains of a 33-m long and 5-m wide longhouse and other structures in the form of a paved street, etc. have been found, which have been dated to 1020 and 1145.





Sigmundur Brestisson


Sigmundur Brestisson was a chieftain mentioned in the Færeyingasaga. The chieftain Tróndur í Gøtu, who killed his father, Brestir Sigmundason, raised Sigmundur and then sent him to Norway. As an adult, Sigmundur returned with his kinsman Tóri to the Faroe Islands, where, according to the saga, he introduced Christianity in 999. However, this did not go smoothly, and Tróndur í Gøtu was both forced to get baptised and accept Sigmundur’s rule over the Faroe Islands.

Tróndur í Gøtu later took revenge by attacking Sigmundur, who lived on Skúvoy. Sigmundur, Tóri and the farmhand Einar escaped by jumping into the sea where Tóri and Einar drowned, while Sigmundur managed to swim to Sandvík on Suðuroy. However, while laying exhausted on the beach, he was killed by the farmer Torgrímur Illi. Since then, Sigmundur and Tróndur have stood as opposites, where especially those who are in favour of independence have taken Tróndur to heart.

A statue of Sigmundur has been erected in front of Vesturkirkjan.

1536-1850 on the Faroe Islands

ROYAL DANISH LIBRARY The Reformation was introduced around 1538 and was fully implemented in 1540 when an Evangelical superintendent replaced the last Catholic bishop. The diocese was abolished in 1557 when the Faroe Islands became a deanery under the Diocese of Bergen, and in 1620 under the Diocese of Zealand. During the Reformation, the church estate was placed under the crown. That constituted about 48 % of the total land value in the Faroe Islands, while the crown estate accounted for around 5 %. The crown estate was subsequently granted to the King’s yeomen.

In the period leading up to 1619, Faroese trade was handled by various agencies. At the beginning, the king had a monopoly on trade, but in some years, the Faroese were allowed to trade freely. Magnus Heinason took over the trading rights in 1579. During the five years he was in charge of the trade, he built a redoubt in Tórshavn to defend the city against pirates.





Changes in administration and trade


In 1619, Islandsk Kompagni acquired the rights to trade in the Faroe Islands, which meant that trade was moved from Bergen to Copenhagen. The secular and the ecclesiastical administration of the Faroe Islands also moved to Copenhagen at the same time, thus ending the close ties between the Faroe Islands and Norway, which had been of such great importance throughout the Middle Ages.

Administratively, the change was not that significant, since the Faroe Islands were still governed according to Norwegian laws and regulations, but within commerce the change was considerable. Since trade was managed indirectly via Norway, dried fish was an important commodity, but Islandsk Kompagni was more interested in stockings than in fish. The Faroese got a fair price for woollen stockings, which gradually became the most important export item.

The impact of the changes were not felt administratively until 1655, when King Frederik III appointed the Dane Balzer Jacobsen as lawman. He was appointed against the will of the Løgting, and the discontent among the members of the old Faroese court was so great that the lawman was soon named the evil lawman. The fact that the king appointed someone other than the Løgting wanted was clear evidence that the absolute monarchy was becoming stronger and stronger, while the Løgting’s power gradually weakened. However, the state was not yet so strong that it was able to stand up to the Løgting, so a few years later Balzer Jacobsen resigned as lawman, and the person that the Løgting had originally recommended was appointed. In the following 100 years, all lawmen were Faroese.





The Gabel era


The first redoubt in Tórshavn was built in approx. 1580 by Magnus Heinason. After World War II, when British soldiers made changes in connection with the occupation, the redoubt was restored to the layout it had after around 1794. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 At the same time as attempts were made to appoint a Dane as lawman in the Faroe Islands, Christoffer Gabel was granted the Faroe Islands as a fief, and in 1662, he was also given charge of trade in the Faroe Islands. Christoffer Gabel was one of the king’s closest advisers when absolute monarchy was introduced in 1660. Christoffer Gabel’s son, Frederik Gabel, inherited the fief from his father and held it until his death in 1708.

While Frederik Gabel managed the trade, it gradually became more and more difficult to sell Faroese stockings, which meant that the trade generated an increasingly large deficit. Gabel and his merchants decided that, in the future, the trade should accept raw wool instead of buying knitted stockings, a decision that caused great discontent when announced in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese knew that the decision would result in the loss of their most important source of income, which was linked to preparing the wool for the production of stockings. The Løgting convened to express their dissatisfaction, and it was clear that an uprising was imminent if the decision was not withdrawn. The members of the Løgting agreed that the living conditions of the Faroese would become unbearable if this source of income disappeared.

When word of the discontent reached Copenhagen, the king ordered the Løgting to send a delegation of four of the country’s most gifted men to Copenhagen to discuss the matter. The negotiations resulted in a new trade tariff being set for all the goods that the trade sold or bought in the Faroe Islands. This trade tariff from 1691 largely appeased the Faroese, but meant that Frederik Gabel had a deficit from the Faroese trade until his death. For the Faroese, the trade tariff meant that it was totally clear how many goods they had to sell to the trade in order to get what they needed. The trade tariff from 1691 is called the Centennial Tariff, as it remained in force almost unchanged until 1790.





From royal monopoly to free trade


Today, the headquarters of the Faroese Government are located on Tinganes in Tórshavn, with the Prime Minister’s office at the far end of the headland. However, until 1856, the Royal Faroese Trade Monopoly was based in these historic buildings.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 When Frederik Gabel died in 1708, the Gabel family’s time as feudal overlord ended. The absolute monarappointchy became better and better organised during these years, and now the administration in Copenhagen had to manage this part of the kingdom. A board was appointed which was to prepare a report regarding the country’s public holdings in the Faroe Islands. One of the board members was the king’s administrative officer, who was employed as the sovereign king’s representative and was in charge of public affairs in the Faroe Islands. The administrative officer was also to manage trade, and he was to serve as a guarantor that everything was settled correctly in connection with the king’s takeover of the trade from the Gabel family in 1709. The other two board members were a superior ranking navy officer and the Faroese lawman.

The board’s work resulted in the Commission’s report of 1709‑10 regarding the state of the Faroe Islands following the King’s takeover of the monopoly in the Faroe Islands. This report long formed the basis for how the central administration in Copenhagen managed the Faroe Islands, and the period 1709‑25 reflected that the administration tried to gain control over all matters relating to the Faroe Islands. However, subsequently, the administration in Copenhagen showed only limited interest in meddling in Faroese affairs until around 1770.

When the king took over the monopoly, he also took over the deficit it had long had from the trade with Faroese stockings. The demand for the stockings increased, however, and during the 1720s the deficit became a surplus, and both the trade and the Faroese became interested in producing as many stockings as possible.

The demand created economic progress throughout most of the 18th century, but around 1770, all the wool that could be obtained from Faroese sheep was used up. When it was no longer possible to make progress by increasing resources, the big question became who should be given the right to the limited resources. This issue is undoubtedly the reason behind the act of the 21st of May 1777, which in a Faroese historical context is often called the Slave Law. Now peasants in the villages could be forced into labour, and the law also made it possible to prohibit marriage until after four years of employment on a farm. Furthermore, the intent of the law was to encourage the intensification of grain cultivation. This was part of the physiocratic movement where the physiocrats believed that welfare could only be increased if the land was made to produce more.

The monopoly trade caused a large deficit in the 1780s, so a committee was set up in 1789 to prepare proposals on how it could be abolished. When a proposal for new regulations for trade in the Faroe Islands was presented the following year, it led to objections from the Faroe Islands, which is why the abolition of monopoly trade was initially postponed until 1796. However, it was not abolished, and free trade was not introduced until 60 years later in 1856.





The establishment of Faroe County


Emilius Løbner became acting chief administrative officer in the Faroe Islands in 1816 and in 1821, he became the first real chief administrative officer with residence in the Faroe Islands. PER Á HÆDD/3269/TJÓÐSAVNIÐ, 1999 Administratively, the administrative officer and the lawman were the highest authorities in the Faroe Islands in the 18th century. In 1720, a prefect was appointed for the Faroe Islands and Iceland, but when the prefect settled in Bessastaðir in Iceland in 1770, it became difficult for him to manage the Faroese part of his office. Therefore, in 1776 the Faroe Islands came under the aegis of the prefect of Zealand County. The prefect had a deputy in the Faroe Islands who could make decisions in cases that could not await processing in Denmark. Usually, the administrative officer or the lawman were the prefect’s deputies. When the War with England broke out in 1807, the old administrative officer and the commandant of the Skansin redoubt in Tórshavn were both deputies of the prefect, and as a result of the war, they served to a still greater extent as an independent form of ‘chief administrative officers’.

With the Treaty of Kiel in 1814, the Danish king lost Norway, but the old Norwegian tributaries of the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland remained under the Danish crown. Accordingly, the central administration in Copenhagen wanted to strengthen its administration of the Faroe Islands. At the beginning, the chief administrative officer did not want to give up the task, but when he was given another office in May 1816, it was only natural to make some changes. With the appointment of the new chief administrative officer for Zealand County, it was decided to establish the Faroe County with a provisional chief administrative officer in the Faroe Islands. The commandant of the redoubt, who had previously served as deputy to the chief administrative officer, was appointed to hold this office. At the same time, the centuries-old Løgting and the office of lawman were abolished, whereby the chief administrative officer alone became the highest authority in the Faroe Islands.





Reforms and modernisation


C. Rosenmeier’s prospectus of Tórshavns Østre Vaag in 1782. It was made when Ryberg’s trade had a great influence on the small town, which was, however, the largest in the North Atlantic.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK A central administration was also created together with the office of chief administrative officer, who to a greater extent than the civil servants in the old system was able to promote changes, even though the strong peasants of the peasant society opposed any reforms. In 1821, the commandant was appointed chief administrative officer, but being a military man, he was less of a reformist. However, this changed in 1825, when the first of several young jurists was appointed chief administrative officer, leading to accelerated modernisation of society. For example, in 1829 both a hospital was built and a fund was founded to establish schools.

It soon became clear to these chief administrative officers that the monopoly trade was the biggest obstacle to the development of Faroese society. However, it was also the monopoly trade that ensured access to the necessary goods, which was a security that the Faroese could hardly give up. The chief administrative officers believed that the monopoly trade had also prevented the development of the Faroese, so that they were intellectually unable to accept free trade. It was therefore necessary to prepare them for free trade, and among the measures they introduced was the establishment of a school system and the creation of several trading branches. The chief administrative officers led the efforts to support those who wanted to settle in outlying villages or who wanted to cultivate new land. They became aware early on that the greatest opportunity for economic growth was in developing the fishing industry. This type of industry was started in the 1830s, and commercial boat fishery was established in the last years leading up to the abolishment of monopoly trade in 1856.

All these measures resulted in strong growth in population numbers. While in 1801 there were around 5,000 inhabitants, the population had grown to around 8,500 when monopoly trade was abolished and that growth continued. The Faroe Islands transitioned into a period that was characterised by considerable development as well as profound changes.





Nólsoyar-Páll


On 26 April 2016, on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of Nólsoyar-Páll’s birth, a stamp with his portrait was released. It was drawn by Archibald Black and engraved by Martin Mörck.

POSTA FAROE ISLANDS Poul Poulsen Nolsøe (1766‑1808) was born on Nólsoy, hence the name Nólsoyar-Páll. He started long-distance shipping early on, graduated as ship’s mate in Copenhagen and sailed as a shipmaster to, e.g., America.

After living in Copenhagen with his Faroese wife, he moved to the Faroe Islands around 1800. After the death of his first wife, he married a farmer’s daughter in Klaksvík, where he became a King’s yeoman.

He left his mark as a proponent of free trade. He built the first ship in the Faroe Islands, Royndin Fríða, in 1804. During the Napoleonic Wars, the supply of goods to the Faroe Islands was unreliable, and in this connection, in 1807, he obtained a special permission from the Danish crown prince to take a cargo of grain to the Faroe Islands on his ship. In mid-November 1808, when Tórshavn had been sacked and famine threatened, Nólsoyar-Páll set out again from London for the Faroe Islands with a cargo of grain, but the ship was wrecked and never arrived. He was then 42 years old.

Nólsoyar-Páll was not always in line with the Danish civil servants, despite the fact that his brother worked for the trade, and he composed a large number of satiric ballads (tættir) about Danish civil servants. The most famous is Fuglakvæðið, written in 1806‑07, in which he compares the civil servants to birds of prey and himself to the oystercatcher, which protects the smaller and innocent birds. Many of his ballads are still sung in connection with chain dancing.

Nólsoyar-Páll was rediscovered in the Faroe Islands especially after Jakob Jakobsen’s biography of him from 1912 and has since been regarded as a national hero.

1850-1920 on the Faroe Islands

	 	The period 1850‑1920 defined the legal position of the Faroe Islands in the Danish kingdom as well as the administrative, cultural and political development of the Faroe Islands.





Position in the kingdom and administration

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK When the Danish Assemblies of the Estates of the Realm were convened in 1830, it proved a challenge to incorporate the former Norwegian tributaries into the Danish kingdom. Unlike Denmark and partly also Iceland, the Faroese peasant society was not a class society with defined lower and upper classes. However, the Danish electoral system could not be used in Iceland or in the Faroe Islands, but the Icelanders were represented by Icelanders appointed by the king, while the Faroes were represented by a former Danish civil servant in the Faroe Islands. Furthermore, there was the difference that the Icelanders had their Althing re-established as a special Icelandic estate assembly already in 1843, while Faroese applications from 1844 and 1846 to establish a similar representation of the Faroese people were not granted. The outcome was that, while in 1851, the Danish authorities failed to enforce the June Constitution from 1849 in Iceland, which was already politically more self-governing at the time, there was no opposition among the Faroese population to the Constitution entering into force in 1850.

Thus, the Faroe Islands’ legal position as part of the Danish constitutional area was established, while Iceland paved the way towards sovereignty in 1918 and 1944, respectively. The Løgting was restored in 1852 in the form of a county council with advisory powers vis-à-vis the Danish parliament (the Rigsdag), which had legislative authority in the entire Danish constitutional area. The powerful chairman of the Løgting became the chief administrative officer, who, with the exception of the period 1897‑1911, was always a Dane, while the dean became a permanent member. The Faroese elected 18 members to the Løgting, who, under the leadership of the chief administrative officer, were to undertake the administration of the islands.

As part of the Danish constitutional area, the Faroese were also given the right to elect two representatives for the bicameral Danish Rigsdag, one in the Folketing and one in the Landsting. The Faroese voters elected the Folketing representative by direct election, while the Landsting representative was elected by indirect election. From 1867, it became the Løgting which elected the Landsting representative from among its members.

With some minor and insignificant changes in 1854, this provided the administrative framework for the Løgting’s activities until a major revision of the Løgting Act in 1923. In 1906, however, the electoral system for the Løgting was changed from single-member constituencies to prioritised lists candidacy, at the same time as secret and written elections replaced oral and public elections. In 1916, women were guaranteed franchise on equal terms with men.

At the same time as the restoration of the Løgting, relieving officers were introduced on the islands, but it was not until 1866 that Tórshavn was established as an independent municipal unit, and with the Municipal Act of 1872 the number of municipalities was set to eight. However, due to division already in 1876, the number of municipalities was 12, and this development escalated towards the end of the period. The number of municipalities increased from 15 to 33 from 1908 to 1920.





Business and population

JOHANNES KLEIN/NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK Until well into the 1800s, Faroese society can be characterised as a traditional peasant society, which supported itself by farming and related fishing organised around the village community. Rights to catch birds, pilot whales and fish with open boats were organised according to the access to land, which could be either the king’s copyhold land or private freehold land. The poor had limited access to marry and establish their own family and had to support themselves by working for the landowners. Originally, every man in the village had the right to a place in the large farmers’ boats and therefore also a right to his share of the catch. But when fishing started becoming detached from the occupational structure of peasant community in the mid-19th century, it was increasingly perceived as a duty. The Slave Act from 1777 was repealed in 1846, and the farmers’ first right to assign men from the village to their boats was repealed in 1865.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK During the monopoly, trading only took place in Tórshavn, which is why Faroese from all other parts of the country had to travel there to trade. A plan in 1709 to open a trading station branch on Suðuroy had been abandoned, since the authorities did not think that, as in Tórshavn – which was fortified by a redoubt – it was possible to defend the branch against pirates. It was not until 1836, 1838 and 1839 that three trading station branches were established in Tvøroyri, Klaksvík and Vestmanna, respectively. With the release of trade, the property of the monopoly was sold to private individuals who established trading stations in these and many other places.

At the beginning, line fishing on the Faroese coasts formed the basis of the trading stations’ business and the fishing industry, but in 1872 the Faroese bought the first sloop from England, which gave a boost to fishing off Iceland. Sloop fishing revolutionised Faroese society. Merchants, shipowners, shipmasters and fishermen became the dominant class instead of farmers and servants. In 1801, 1 % of the population, which at the time totalled around 5,000 inhabitants, stated that they supported themselves by fishing, while 85 % stated that they supported themselves by agriculture. A hundred years later, 53 % of a now tripled population of around 15,000 inhabitants stated that they made a living from fishing, while 18.4 % made a living from agriculture. Fishing, which together with agriculture was the basis for population growth, became increasingly important throughout the 19th century. In absolute figures, however, the statistics show that the number of people living from agriculture grew until 1850, after which this number also declined in absolute figures.

At the end of the 19th century, especially when coastal fishing failed, many went to live, fish and work in Iceland for two or three months during summer. It was called ‘fara til lands’. During the summer of 1880, there were about 100 Faroese fishing cutters that fished off the coast of Iceland; in 1890, around 1,000 Faroese went to Iceland to live and work. The men took part in coastal fishing and the women prepared the cod for drying.

The strong population growth from 1850 to 1920 from around 8,000 to around 20,000 people led to major shifts in population trends and between geographical areas. While the agricultural society had distributed the population relatively evenly over the entire arable Faroese agricultural land, the trading and fishing society created population concentration and growth around areas with natural harbours. Trading stations were established here, and sloops were berthed and overwintered in the ports where the catch from the Iceland fishery was landed. Here, the fish products were processed into dried and salted fish, which were sold mainly to southern European markets. Shipowners and labour concentrated in these places where there were business opportunities related to trading and fishing as well as work for men and women.

This development first started in Tvøroyri and Vági on Suðuroy, but later also reached Tórshavn and Vestmanna. In Vági (later Klaksvík) on Norðoyggjar, where the monopoly trade had had a branch, development also soon got under way, but it was not until after 1900 that this societal development really took hold in Klaksvík. Around 1920, the traditionally dominant agricultural villages were outperformed by fishing villages such as Tvøroyri, Vágur, Vestmanna, Klaksvík and Tórshavn.

This development did not only change population trends. The more heterogeneous population composition in the rootless immigrant villages also changed the identity of these places and provided breeding ground for new cultural centres with a culture that was less characterised by agriculture.

Færø Amts Sparekasse (which went bankrupt under the name Eik Banki in 2010 and has now been restored under the name Betri Banki) was already established in 1832, but market and fishing communities also needed banks. In 1906, Landmandsbanken, later called Danske Bank, established Føroya Banki, and in 1932, the first Faroese-owned bank, Sjóvinnubankin (Fishery Bank), was established.





Culture, schools and education

JOHANNES KLEIN/NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK One of the oldest Faroese cultural institutions, the Faroe County Library, was established by chief administrative officer Christian Ludvig Tillisch and Jens Davidsen in 1828, today Landsbókasavnið (the National library of the Faroe Islands). Tjóðsavnið (National Museum of the Faroe Islands) was established in 1898. A national revival or perhaps rather (re)creation of Faroese culture was on the way in the 19th century.

The Faroese peasant culture had only survived centuries of influence from Danish written culture as an oral tradition, but in 1846, the modern Faroese orthography was constructed. The first compulsory school system – provisional regulations – was created in 1846, but was short-lived due to Faroese protests. It was not the school language, Danish, that was the cause of the many protests, but rather the expensive system and the fact that the families needed the children in their daily work. Already in 1854, the newly established democratic Løgting therefore decided to abolish the school system. At the same time, a secondary school, which moved into a new building in 1861, was established in Tórshavn.

It was not until the Municipal Act of 1872 that compulsory schooling was finally re-established in the Faroe Islands. This time it became the municipalities’ responsibility to ensure the implementation of compulsory schooling. Before that, in 1870, a new teachers’ school was established in Tórshavn, which was supposed to supply the schools with trained teachers. In 1884, women were allowed to apply for admission to the school.

Awareness of the special Faroese identity and the need for information about Faroese matters increased in the latter half of the 19th century. The first Faroese newspaper, Færingetidende, was published in 1852, but the newspaper was written in Danish and was published only nine times. Færø Amtstidende (later Dimmalætting), which has been published since 1877, also in Danish, did better. In contrast, Føringatíðindi from 1890 was the first Faroese newspaper published in Faroese. It was one of the most important signs of the nascent national movement, which formally began with the Christmas Meeting in Tórshavn on 26 December 1888; a public meeting where the preservation of Faroese culture and language was up for debate and which resulted in the foundation of the association Føringafelag. The newspaper used the orthography from 1846, but at that time a different orthography had been proposed by Jakob Jakobsen, which caused disagreement, and the newspaper was published the last time in 1906. Instead, the cultural-radical and selfgovernment-oriented Tingakrossur came in 1901, which in the first years was written in Danish.

The traditional oral peasant culture was developing into a written high culture around 1900. The first Faroese newspapers, school books and novels were published during this period. At the beginning of the 20th century, the fight for recognition of the newly found national Faroese identity became a cardinal point in Faroese politics.

A government-supported folk high school was established in Klaksvík in 1899, but it was moved to Føgrulíð already in 1900 – a deserted area just west of Klaksvík. In contrast to other schools and in the church, the folk high school taught in Faroese, and services at the school were also held in Faroese. The national anthem Tú alfagra land mítt was composed in 1906 by Símun av Skarði in Føgrulíð, while the school was located there. It moved to Tórshavn in 1909, where it had a more central location and it was easier to recruit students. The folk high school, which was of great importance for the development of the Faroese language, is still located in the capital.





Communication and traffic


In its ninth year, Tingakrossur was still a relatively radical Faroese newspaper, written in Danish. The cover from 2 June 1909 illustrates an opening to the new Faroese society.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK Communication- and traffic-wise, the Faroese have been connected by the sea and the mountains. Seventeen of the 18 islands have been inhabited, and traffic between the islands used to take place by boat, and during the often rough winter conditions, people had to navigate the Atlantic Ocean. The special arrangement to convey civil servants between the islands and villages meant that the farmers had a duty to row public servants and vicars between the islands. This transport arrangement applied to public servants until 1922 and to vicars until 1936. Postmen walked across the mountains to deliver mail to the various villages no matter the weather. At the end of the 19th century, postal transport by sea between the islands became organised, and the first post offices were established in the 1870s. Private companies organised ship and boat transport between the islands with e.g. milk, goods and passengers; it was not until 1939 that the Løgting took over all rights to carbotage between the islands. Throughout the period, there were mostly only footpaths between the villages and there was no lighting. The first real road between two Faroese villages, Skopun and Sand, was established in 1916.

The cargo ships from Denmark to the monopoly in Tórshavn delivering and collecting goods came in spring and unloaded and loaded cargo at the monopoly’s depots. Later, with free trade in 1856, the number of trading stations and ships increased. Whereas, during the monopoly, the Faroese had to row to Tórshavn at least once a year to buy and sell their goods, they later had to row to the larger trading stations to buy and sell their fish catch, which was then processed there and exported to the large European markets.

There were no fundamental changes in traffic during the period, but in the latter half of the period the boats became larger, and ultimately even motorised decked boats were used. Many traders and shipowners therefore built their own quay facilities for their vessels so that they could dock safely.

If it became necessary to send a quick message between the villages, it was also possible to send smoke signals. This was done in case of an emergency or when a village had discovered pilot whales and it needed help for the killing from men and boats in other villages.

While improvements were made in the physical links between the islands, fundamental changes were also implemented in the communication system. The first telegraph connection with the outside world was established in 1905, and the following year, the first telephone connection was established between two villages.





Politics


Today, the headquarters of the Faroese Government are located on Tinganes in Tórshavn, with the Prime Minister’s office at the far end of the headland. However, until 1856, the Royal Faroese Trade Monopoly was based in these historic buildings.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 It has often been said that Faroese politics did not start until the formation of parties in 1906, when a national conservative cultural movement that was against political change was split in two by a breakaway progressive movement that wanted greater political autonomy as a result of the newly found national Faroese identity. However, it probably started much earlier.

Already in 1844, the same year that some members of the estate assembly in Roskilde characterised the Faroese language as merely a depraved Danish dialect, a group of Faroese living in Copenhagen applied to the estate assembly for a parliament in the Faroe Islands. The application was clearly inspired by Iceland, which in 1843 had established its own estate assembly, yet the application showed an awakening political consciousness in the Faroe Islands. When the application did not make the agenda in 1844, 28 Faroese applied again in 1846 – the same year that the Faroese written language was constructed – for a parliament to be established in the Faroe Islands. This time the application made the agenda and was considered, but although it was rejected, there were similarities between the proposal made in the application and the Løgting that was ultimately re-established in 1852. And since then several proposals to expand the Løgting’s powers were submitted to the Løgting in the period from 1874 to 1920. These examples show that the political track was not simply a causal consequence of a preceding cultural period, but rather parallel tracks that can be traced back to the 1840s. What was new in 1906 was that the Faroe Islands had the first actual political parties and a relatively autonomous political system.

From 1851, Faroese stood as candidates for Danish parties to the Danish Rigsdag and later to the Løgting, and the lines of separation were often the same as the Danish. The first political controversies appeared already at the beginning, but culminated in 1860, when a majority of the Løgting’s members, 12 out of 18, became so displeased with the chairman of the Løgting, country administrative officer Dahlerup, that they left the Løgting and refused to return until he had been removed. Dahlerup was undoubtedly a skilled Danish civil servant, but he was unable to reconcile or mediate between very differing views among the elected Faroese in the Løgting.





Political personalities

3350F04427, TJÓÐSAVNIÐ Among the notable political personalities during this period was Niels Winther, who was the Faroe Islands’ first member of the Danish Folketing and also among the first members of the Løgting in 1852. He had wanted a more open-minded Løgting without civil servants, but ended up voting in favour of the proposal for the Law on the Faroe Islands’ Løgting of 1851. In 1852, Winther published the Faroe Islands’ first newspaper, Færingetidende, where he quickly fell out of favour following his harsh and uncompromising accusations against the civil servants and was convicted of falsely accusing them of fraud. Niels Winther was a member of the Danish Folketing and the Løgting until 1857, when he left the Faroe Islands and settled in Hjørring, Denmark.

Another prominent personality was Johan Hendrik Schröter, who in 1884 submitted proposals to the Løgting for a significant democratisation of the assembly, which would have to choose its own chairman, as well as an expansion of the Løgting’s powers. However, the proposal proved too far-reaching for the Løgting, which rejected it. Other proposals were rejected by the Danish government since the chief administrative officer advised against adopting them.

It was not until the aftermath of the democratisation that accompanied the system change in the early 1900s that some changes in attitude could be seen in Denmark and the Faroe Islands. The new member of the Danish Folketing Jóannes Patursson, who was first elected in 1903, managed to garner the support of J.C. Christensen’s government for giving the Løgting more political and economic wriggle room. At the same time, the Løgting elected the self-government-oriented Christian Bærentsen, the only Faroese who was ever a chief administrative officer in the Faroe Islands, as Faroese member of the Danish Landsting. A system change had thus taken place. In 1906, Jóannes Patursson managed to make a deal with the Danish government that the Løgting should take over some county-municipal areas (ports, roads and telephony). The Løgting should also be given authority to collect taxes, and if the revenues were not sufficient, the Løgting should be able to apply to the Danish government for an annual state subsidy.





Election to the Løgting in 1906

5074F05, TJÓÐSAVNIÐ However, in the subsequent 1906 general election, which debated the deal with the Danish government, it became evident that a large majority of the Faroese voters refused to recognise the agreement. One reason was that the opponents argued that taxes would skyrocket because of the deal. Furthermore, Patursson could not guarantee that the Danish government would be willing to support the deal with an annual state subsidy. The decisive factor, however, was that the powerful Faroese temperance movement, which wanted a ban on alcohol, strongly opposed the deal, which was intended to be partly financed by a higher tax on alcohol.

Consequently, Jóannes Patursson and the independence supporters, as they were then called, lost all three elections in the Faroe Islands in 1906: the election to the Danish Folketing, the election to the Løgting and, as a logical consequence, the election to the Danish Landsting. The newly elected Løgting rejected the deal, and the temperance movement prompted a referendum to ban alcohol in 1907. The result was a convincing victory for the temperance movement, but it did not lead to the total ban on alcohol that the temperance movement had wanted. The ban only applied to the sale and serving of alcohol (brandy, wine and beer), while the Faroese were still allowed to import alcohol for their own consumption.

The scheme, with various amendments, remained in force 1992, when a public monopoly on the sale of alcohol was established. Politically, the matter relating to the deal with the Danish government was a major defeat for the independence supporters, and the division between unity and independence supporters became a main dividing line in Faroese politics after 1906. As a result of the disputes, Sambandsflokkurin (the Unionist Party), which wanted the Løgting to practice austerity in its work as well as unchanged relations between Denmark and the Faroe Islands, was established in 1906. Sjálvstýrisflokkurin (the Independence Party), which wanted as much autonomy as could be achieved in agreement with the Danish government and the Danish Rigsdag, was formally established in 1909. According to the party’s platform, it wanted to ensure the same rights for the Faroese language as Danish in the Faroe Islands, and an improvement of the school system based on the Faroese language. Furthermore, no law should be enforceable without the approval of the Løgting.

Sambandsflokkurin dominated the Løgting in the years after 1906, but conflicts over more rights in terms of the Faroese language and greater political autonomy were ever-present throughout the period. In 1912, a large majority in the Løgting adopted a new school act, section 12 of which established Danish as the language of instruction. An act on parochial church councils, which established Danish as the language of the church, was also adopted. In 1915, a proposal from Sjálvstýrisflokkurin to grant legislative authority to the Løgting in special Faroese matters was rejected by the Løgting. Sjálvstýrisflokkurin had difficulty leaving its mark during this period, but World War I and the general election in 1916 showed that Sjálvstýrisflokkurin might have a chance to break the long-standing dominance of Sambandsflokkurin. Sjálvstýrisflokkurin won the general election in 1916, but since only one half of the members were up for election in 1916, Sambandsflokkurin retained the majority.





The period during and after World War I


The difficult trading conditions in the North Atlantic during World War I changed the political climate and political priorities. The British demand that all trade ships in the North Atlantic should sail to a contraband control in a British port – Kirkwall in the case of the Faroe Islands to Kirkwall – did not initially cause major problems. However, this changed in February 1917 when, as a countermeasure, Germany introduced unrestricted submarine warfare against all ships that sailed into specific waters around the British Isles; the boundary of the danger zone was just three nautical miles from the southernmost point of the Faroe Islands. Several trade and fishing ships were sunk on their way to and near the Faroe Islands, and for some months no goods made it to the islands. In this tense situation, the politicians in favour of independence, who had previously reached out to the Danish government, approached the Danish envoy in London in April 1917 with a request that ships coming from the USA and Iceland to the Faroe Islands with goods could be exempted from contraband control in the perilous British ports. In May 1917, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs became involved in the matter, and after a request to the British government, trade ships from the USA and Iceland with a British license were permitted to call at Halifax in Canada instead for contraband control.

This matter could have been ended in May 1917, but ended up having political consequences in Denmark in 1918. C.Th. Zahle’s social liberal-social democratic government, which had had good political relations with Sjálvstýrisflokkurin, did not have the same good relationship with the Danish political opposition, which had the majority in the Danish Landsting. There was great opposition to the Zahle government’s handling of the sale of the Danish West Indies in 1917 and the impending agreement with Iceland to recognise the country as a sovereign state. But things got even worse when, in March 1918, Zahle sent a telegram to Svenning Rytter, the chief administrative officer in the Faroe Islands, in which he indicated his support of Sjálvstýrisflokkurin’s candidate in the upcoming April general election, and asked the chief administrative officer to inform the candidate of his position. Rytter, who believed that he had fought against the independence supporters and for Denmark’s interests in the Faroe Islands during the war, was so indignant that he, together with the judge of the Faroese Court of Justice and the administrative officer, requested to be transferred to other positions in Denmark – otherwise they would resign. Against this background, the conservative opposition in the Danish Landsting decided to set up a commission in July 1918. The commission was, among other things, tasked with looking into Zahle’s relationship with the independence supporters. Furthermore, the commission was charged with investigating everything relating to the request of the Faroese independence supporters to the British government in April 1917.





The 1920 commission report


A very comprehensive commission report, which in the majority report (the opposition) accused the independence supporters of high treason and subversive activities, was submitted to the Danish Landsting for further consideration in January 1920. The minority (the government’s members in the commission, including one of the majority’s main suspects, Jóannes Patursson) responded that no illegal activities had taken place, but that the Danish Landsting with its accusations had damaged the good relationship between Denmark and the Faroe Islands. The accusations were, like the commission, fundamentally political, so the report did not have any legal consequences. The only thing that the majority in the Danish Landsting agreed to was to officially criticise Zahle for his inadequate briefing of the Landsting on the reasons why the three Faroese civil servants had applied for transfer or dismissal in March 1918.

A few months later, the king dismissed Zahle’s government in connection with disagreements about Flensburg; the Landsting Commission of 1918 thus played no role in the dismissal. According to the Danish historian Jørgen Steining, the matter did have political consequences since Jóannes Patursson became ‘an enemy of the Danish State for all time’. Sjálvstýrisflokkurin in particular was dissatisfied that Svenning Rytter became the new minister for justice and directly responsible for Faroese affairs in Niels Th. Neergaard’s Liberal Party government, which was in power between 1920 and 1924.

1920-1970 on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	The modern Faroese society was established during the period from 1920 to 1970. The democratic reforms establishing the Løgting as an exclusively democratic institution were adopted, the modern political party system was established and the Løgting was given legislative authority over Faroese affairs. The Løgting also gained control over the Faroese economy, and most cultural objectives, including the position of the language in schools and the church as well as the question of recognition of the flag, were defined during this period. Relations with Denmark were also challenged, but secession did not materialise.





Position in the kingdom and administration


The position of the Faroe Islands in the kingdom remained unchanged throughout the period, but several crises led to some quite fundamental changes between Denmark and the Faroe Islands. One of the less dramatic events was the new Løgting Act from 1923, which established that the Løgting was a consultative assembly, but the right of the Løgting to consider decisions by Danish national authorities was emphasised. A significant change was that the chief administrative officer no longer had to be a permanent member and chairman of the Løgting. The Løgting would now choose a chairman from among its elected members to lead debates; the chief administrative officer as well as the dean would only become members if they were elected by the voters.

However, the chief administrative officer had a seat in the Løgting and could (without the right to vote) participate in the Løgting’s debates on an equal footing with elected members. However, the Løgting’s status as a consultative assembly meant that the chief administrative officer had a strong position vis-à-vis the Løgting. He had the right to postpone the implementation of resolutions of the Løgting until he had verified that they were in compliance with the applicable legislation. Moreover, the king, i.e. in practice the Danish Government, had the right to dissolve the Løgting and call elections for the parliament. Another significant change was in the electoral system for the Løgting, which, until now, had several times meant that the political party getting the majority of the votes did not get the majority of members in the Løgting.

So the parties in the Løgting were thus able to agree on democratic reforms, but the Løgting’s position as a consultative assembly was maintained, and legislative power was vested in the Danish Rigsdag.

An administrative strengthening of the Løgting, which was generally only in session for six weeks after the ólavsøka festival, was introduced in 1928: A national council consisting of representatives from all political parties, which also had to meet between parliamentary sessions, was established. At the same time, the Løgting got its own administration with a head of department. Administratively speaking, the Løgting had thus become relatively independent of the chief administrative officer’s administration, but it was still subject to the chief administrative officer’s supervision and legal control.





The Home Rule Act

ERIK PETERSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX With the Home Rule Act of 1 April 1948, the Løgting acquired legislative authority in special Faroese matters, which were defined in list A, and over which the Løgting could easily take responsibility. Following negotiations and agreement with the Danish authorities, the Løgting was also able to take over other fields of common interest that were on list B. The special matters on list A included direct and indirect taxes, administration, health services, public welfare services, schools, municipal affairs, etc., while the areas on list B included the Evangelical Lutheran Church, underground deposits of raw materials, police and the Land Fund.

Another list identified areas that could not be transferred to the Faroese authorities, including foreign policy, defence, the Supreme Court and monetary affairs.

In addition to the Løgting, which had legislative power in matters taken over by the Faroe Islands, a Faroese Government in the form of the Landstyret was established. This was to administer the Faroese affairs taken over by the home rule.

Section 2 of the Home Rule Act stipulated that if the home rule wanted to take over a matter on list A or list B, the home rule would simultaneously assume full responsibility and the associated financial rights and obligations. Section 9, however, contained an exception to this general rule. According to this section, the home rule government and the Danish government could reach agreement by negotiation on ‘the extent to which’ a field of common interest area (i.e. an area not taken over on list A or an area on list B) could be transferred to the home rule. It was thus possible to take over parts of an area, but it would require agreement between the home rule and the Danish government.

From 1908 to the mid-1960s, A/S Thorshavns Mælkeforsyning og Margarinefabrik was in charge of the maritime postal services and the liner between Tórshavn and a number of villages on Streymoy and Eysturoy by what was called mjólkarbátar (milk boats). Photo from 1963.

ERIK PETERSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX A takeover under Section 9 did thus not have the same status as a takeover under Section 2, since it, in the first case, was only the authority to issue executive orders that was taken over, while, in the second case, it was also the legislative authority. Accordingly, a matter could be taken over twice, the first time partially under section 9 and then completely under section 2, but it could also be taken over once under section 2.

The office of the chief administrative officer was abolished and replaced with the High Commissioner of The Faroe Islands. The High Commissioner of The Faroe Islands had the right, without having a right to vote, to participate in the debates of the Løgting, but, contrary to the chief administrative officer, had no rights over the Løgting. In case of disagreement about the interpretation of the Home Rule Act, committee consisting of seven people was to be set up to settle the disagreement: two representatives appointed by the home rule and two representatives appointed by the Danish government, respectively, and three representatives appointed by the Supreme Court. If the members appointed by the Danish government and the home rule agreed on the interpretation, the matter was settled.

Direct and indirect taxes were not unexpectedly taken over immediately, and so were administrative matters, both according to section 2. The Home Rule Act stipulated that the Løgting should elect the Faroese Government. The Faroese Government was to be led by a prime minister, who was now given the old designation løgmaður. While the Løgting elected the prime minister and the other members of the Faroese Government, the Faroese Government could only be removed in connection with general elections, which had to be held every four years. The Faroese Government was organised as an administrative committee under the Løgting, whose members could sit in the government, at the same time as they sat in the Løgting. The Faroese Government was also organised as a college where all decisions were made jointly and the members were collectively liable for all decisions.

The Home Rule Act also recognised the Faroese flag and Faroese as the main language.





Municipalities, welfare and the Evangelical Lutheran Church


The increase in the number of municipalities after 1900 continued. While, in 1920, there were 33 municipalities, the number peaked in 1970 with 51 often quite small and sparsely populated municipalities. This created challenges in having central welfare areas, which the home rule had taken over or had plans to take over, handled in the municipalities, as many of them were so small that they simply lacked a population base.

With the Hospitals Act of 1939, the Løgting and the State took over responsibility for all the hospitals, which had previously been local matters. Other state-funded welfare reforms were also introduced in the 1950s and 1960s; the Danish state pension from 1957 was introduced in the Faroe Islands in 1959 with the support of all parties.

The Faroese Evangelical Lutheran Church, which since 1923 had belonged to the Diocese of Copenhagen, was established as an independent vice-diocese in 1963, and the vice-bishop took over from the dean. In 1990, the Faroe Islands were separated from the Diocese of Copenhagen and became an independent diocese with its own bishop, and the church in Tórshavn became a cathedral.





Business and population

ANDREAS NOLSØE NICLASEN/NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK In 1920, the Faroese society had changed from an agricultural society to a trading and fishing society. Major demographic shifts occurred between the various areas. The population moved from the traditional agricultural villages to the new trading stations, where shipowners and shipmasters concentrated their businesses. The sloops came from Iceland with fish to be dried and salted, providing work for both men and women. Whereas the sloops in the 1920s mostly fished with line off Iceland, line fishing from the larger schooners off the coast of Greenland did not really begin until the 1930s. Already in 1925, a Faroese port opened in Greenland, from where the ships could operate.

Fishing in the Faroe Islands was difficult, since English trawlers often trawled close to the coast, however, during World War I, fishing activities off the Faroe Islands increased since the English trawlers were absent during this period. They came back after the war, however, forcing the Faroese to find other places to fish.

The long journey with the sloops and schooners to Iceland or Greenland was dangerous in bad weather, and many shipwrecks in the 1920s and 1930s had a profound impact on the Faroese population. Economically, times were not favourable either, and the 1930s in particular were tough. The world economic crisis in 1929 also hit the Faroe Islands hard. The Faroese exported most of their catch of fish, especially the salted fish, to the markets in Southern Europe, however, exports were very unstable. Spain was in civil war in the 1930s, Greece experienced political unrest and economic crisis, and the League of Nations boycotted Fascist Italy because of the invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935. These important markets were thus almost closed to Faroese exports.

World War II, however, created extremely good opportunities for Faroese business and economy. The Faroe Islands, which in the 1930s had been all but cut off from sales in the lucrative English fresh fish market, now had almost free access to this market. Great Britain needed its navy – also its fishing fleet – for the war and therefore had to leave it to other countries to supply the British with fish. The conversion of the Faroese fishing fleet from sail- or partly motor-powered sloops and schooners to coal-powered trawlers had begun in the 1930s, but during the war, virtually the entire fishing industry converted from production of salted fish to fishing for fresh fish and transport of fresh fish to the English market. Fish prices were good, but the cost in lost lives was substantial: About 200 Faroese died at sea during the war. It was also a period of unemployment since the sloops and schooners off Iceland and Greenland had a crew of 15‑20, while only six to eight men were needed for fresh fish fishing and transport. It is estimated that Faroese exports covered 20 % of Great Britain’s consumption of fish during World War II.

After the war, the salt fish production experienced a comeback for a time and continued to a lesser extent when fresh fish production and filleting factories started dominating the industry in the 1960s. An economic crisis arose in the 1950s when the revival of the fishing fleet was initially carried out by investing the war savings in old coal trawlers, which the English replaced with diesel trawlers. This proved to be a bad investment as the coal trawlers were expensive to run, unprofitable and unable to compete with the newer trawlers. A large part of the fleet went bankrupt, and the banks, in particular the Faroese-owned Sjóvinnubankin, had to be reconstructed three times during the 1950s with the help of the Danish Government and the central bank of Denmark.

The fishing industry experienced a major recession, and many fishermen found work on either foreign ships or travelled to Greenland. However, it did help that net fishery for herring grew in the 1950s, because all fishing vessels could be used for herring fishery, even trawlers. In 1962, the herring fishery became even more important with the new power block ships and laid the foundation for the fishing industry factory Havsbrún, which was built in Fuglafjørður in 1966. The crew wages on these new power block ships and shrimp ships in Greenland, where fishing began in 1969, were very high.

The revival in the 1950s took place with the help of the newly established mortgage credit institution, which received capital from the Danish part of the Marshall Aid. This time the Faroese invested in new steel long-line ships and trawlers that supplied the new filleting factories with fresh fish. The revival of the fishing industry was largely completed during the 1960s, and especially the many filleting factories helped change the Faroese fishing industry. All in all, the fishing fleet had now become modern and more varied.

The population increased from around 21,000 in 1920 to around 32,000 in 1950, and in 1970 it was around 38,000. Population growth mainly occurred in Tórshavn and a number of large fishing villages. In 1920, for example, 24.1 % of the total Faroese population lived in Tórshavn (11.7 %), Klaksvík (4.8 %) and Tvøroyri (7.5 %), and in 1970 as much as 44.5 % of the total Faroese population lived in Tórshavn (27.8 %), Klaksvík (11.5 %) and Tvøroyri (5.2 %). Norðoyggjar is an example of the opposite shifts in population that occurred during the period; in 1920, 6.6 % of the country’s population lived in Norðoyggjar (excluding Klaksvík), while just 2.6 % lived there in 1970.

The major societal changes, population growth and demographic shifts created the basis for movements in the spiritual culture. The revival movements had already arrived in the Faroe Islands in the second half of the 19th century, but they did not gain influence until the beginning of the 20th century. The Home Mission, the evangelical wing of the Church of Denmark, enjoyed great support in the 1920s and 1930s, but remained part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, despite religious disagreement. Things were different with the other influential revival movement, the Plymouth Brethren that had come to the Faroe Islands via Scotland with a missionary in 1865. The Plymouth Brethren also gained a lot of support in the 1920s and 1930s, especially in the new large immigrant villages, while the Evangelical Lutheran Church remained strong in many of the traditional agricultural villages.





Infrastructure – roads, ports and transport


In 1920, there were neither roads nor bridges of importance between the villages, but this changed a lot during the period. In 1907, the Hoydalsvegurin was established near Tórshavn, which is considered the first non-urban road in the Faroe Islands, while the road between Skopun and Sand from 1916 is considered the first road between villages. Since then, the road network expanded. In 1921, the Danish Government granted 80 % of the costs for the construction of five roads between Sørvágur, Miðvágur and Sandavágur, between Tórshavn, Velbastaður and Kirkjubøur, between Søldarfjørður, the Gøtu villages and Fuglafjørður, between Kollafjørður and Kvívík and between Sand, Skálavík and Húsavík. In 1955, most of the large villages were connected by road, but roads were still missing to some of the small villages and across mountains, where it was almost impossible to build roads without drilling tunnels through the mountains. Tórshavn was still only connected by roads to Velbastaður and Kirkjubøur, and Norðoyggjar only had a few roads.

In 1965, Oyggjarvegin, the road across the mountains between Tórshavn and Kollafjørður, opened, and in 1965 and 1967, the tunnels connecting Klaksvík and the northern villages were opened for traffic. On Suðuroy, Hvalba got a tunnel to the southern part of the island in 1963, and in 1969, Sandvík got a tunnel to Hvalba and the southern part of the island.

However, the sea remained the only route between the islands, leading to a massive expansion and modernisation of the port facilities. At the beginning of the period, shipowners had built private piers for their ships, but in 1913, the Danish State decided to finance the majority of the large port facilities in major Faroese villages. World War I led to delays in the construction works, but activities resumed in the 1920s. The large port facility at Tórshavn was completed in 1927, and ten years later, in 1937, the last facility in this round was completed in Klaksvík. In the 1930s, port facilities passed from private to municipal ownership.

In 1921, the first power plant in Botni opened at Vágur on Suðuroy. In 1931, a similar municipal power plant opened in Ánirnar at Klaksvík, owned by Klaksvíkar Kommuna. In the 1950s, all the municipal power plants were collected under a common municipal company, SEV. The large power plant in Vestmanna opened in 1953, and in 1974, the plant on Sund was built. This marked the beginning of the expansion of the electricity connection to all villages and islands. In 1970, the last village, Múla on Borðoy, became electrified.

The first telephone line between two villages had been established privately in 1905, but already in the 1930s, all villages were connected to one of the 99 manual telephone exchanges. Several villages only had one telephone. A major advance was made in 1953, when, in Tórshavn, it became possible to call the desired telephone directly by bypassing the public telephone company’s switchboard. However, it was not until 1978 that the last manual switchboards were replaced by direct telephone connection. In 1954, the first telephone connection to Denmark was opened, and in 1971, it became possible to call Denmark directly.





School, education and cultural institutions


The oldest part, Listaskálin, of the Listasavn Føroya art gallery was designed by J.P. Gregoriussen and built in 1970. In 1993, the museum was expanded with a new building, designed by Niels F. Truelsen in collaboration with J.P. Gregoriussen. The sculptor Hans Pauli Olsen created the work The Shadow, which can be seen on the right side of the photo.

BJARNE JAKOBSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2013 A secondary school was established in Tvøroyri in 1923 and in Vági in 1933 on Suðuroy as well as in Klaksvík on Norðoyggjar in 1935. In the 1950s, middle and secondary schools were established in several of the large villages: Vestmanna, Fuglafjørður, Glyvrar and Sørvágur and at Miðvágs-Sandavágs Skúli. In 1962, several schools were given this option, but now there was the option of two tracks: a secondary school leaving examination, which gave access to the high schools, and an 8th, 9th and 10th grade leaving examination, which did not give access to the high schools. In 1971, 14 schools were able to offer secondary or 10th grade school leaving examination.

In 1937, a two-year upper-secondary course was created in Hoydølum near Tórshavn, which was the only one of its kind in the Faroe Islands at the time. During the first years, it was only possible to graduate with a language certificate, but in 1947, it also became possible to graduate with a mathematical-natural science certificate. In 1959, the course was extended to a three-year course, and in 1962 the upper-secondary course became an upper-secondary school, at which point it moved into new premises.

The nursing school was established in 1960. During the first years, students had to travel to Denmark to take part of the education, but since 1979, it has been possible to take the entire education in the Faroe Islands.

In addition to the ordinary evening schools, which offered courses in several subjects, technical colleges for apprentices and business colleges for those who wanted to work in shops were already organised as evening schools in several of the large villages in the 1930s. In 1949, it became possible to take a special commercial certificate, the commercial assistant’s examination. Since 1960, there have only been technical colleges in Tórshavn and Klaksvík. Commercial colleges were organised in the 1960s, and Føroya Handilsskúli in Tórshavn was established in 1967.

Already in 1892, shortly after the sloop era began in 1872, it was possible to take a shipmaster’s exam in the Faroe Islands. During winter, experienced shipmasters organised private teaching for young fishermen, giving them the opportunity to take the shipmaster’s exam. Officers on the Danish coast guard ships at the Faroe Islands were examiners on these courses. In 1906, with the support of the State, an attempt was made to establish a seamen’s school, which was meant to help the students take a ships mate’s certificate, but due to a lack of students, the school, which was located in its own building, was closed down in 1909. The state-funded private schools continued. However, the navigation school in Tórshavn was established in 1928. Already in 1949, the Home Rule took over the navigation school named Tórshavnar Sjómansskúli. The school, which had been housed in the old seamen’s school building from 1906, moved into the new and later refurbished and expanded premises in 1962, where it is still located today. A shipmaster’s and telegraph operator’s school was established in Klaksvík in 1947. The Faroe Islands School of Engineering was established in 1964. In 2008, the engineering school was merged with the seamen’s school in Tórshavn under the new name Vinnuháskúlin (Centre of Maritime Studies & Engineering).

The Faroe County Archives was established as a state institution in 1932, but it was taken over by the Løgting in 1952 and has since been the national archives, now named Tjóðskjalasavnið.

In 1952, Føroya Fornminnissavn, the Faroe Islands Museum of Cultural History, was established by the Løgting, and in 1955 Føroya Náttúrugripasavn (the Faroe Islands National History Museum). The institutions were merged in 2011 under the name Tjóðsavnið (the Faroe Islands National Museum).

Útvarp Føroya (Faroe Islands Radio), which began broadcasting in 1957, was merged in 2005 with Sjónvarp Føroya (Faroe Islands Television), which began broadcasting in 1984. The merged institution is called Kringvarp Føroya, abbreviated KVF.

In 1970, the National Gallery of the Faroe Islands, Listasavn Føroya, was established in Tórshavn.





Politics


The new chief administrative officer’s residence was designed by H.C. Amberg and built of Faroese basalt in 1881. Since the Home Rule Act of 1948, the building has been the residence and administration building of the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands. Photo from around the 1920s.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK In 1918, Sjálvstýrisflokkurin won the majority in the Løgting for the first time and held it until 1923. The party wanted to use its majority to get some of its key issues adopted, and during this period, the Løgting several times decided that Faroese should be the language used in education and the churches. In connection with the constitutional amendment in 1920, the Løgting decided to amend section 2 – that the legislative authority jointly rests with the king and the Danish Rigsdag – so that the Løgting could be granted authority to legislate in special Faroese matters. However, the central authorities of the Realm did not approve any of the Løgting’s decisions. These matters, together with accusations from the Landsting commission in 1919 of subversive activities, caused the relationship between Sjálvstýrisflokkurin and the Danish government led by the Liberal Party to come to a freezing point.

When the disagreement between Denmark and Norway over the North Atlantic islands made a Norwegian professor of international law in 1923 propose that a referendum should be held in the Faroe Islands on whether the islands should belong to Norway or Denmark, it lit a fire. In this connection, the Faroese member of the Danish Landsting, Oliver Effersøe from Sambandsflokkurin, said to the Danish newspapers that the Faroe Islands had been treated well by Denmark and that there was no desire in the Faroe Islands to join Norway. The chairman of Sjálvstýrisflokkurin, Jóannes Patursson, who was in Norway at the time, replied by telegram that, the Landsting member’s statements could only be understood as the Faroe Islands had no desire to join Norway under the same heavyhanded conditions as Denmark enforced against the Faroe Islands at the time.

MORTEN BJØRN JENSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX, 1994 Sambandsflokkurin raised the matter in the Løgting, where the independence supporters supported Jóannes Patursson, and in the Danish Folketing, where Prime Minister Niels Neergaard October 1923 stated that the Danish Government would offer its unconditional support to the forces in the Faroe Islands that wanted to preserve the current constitutional state of affairs. He also emphasised that a condition for Danish support for Faroese language and culture was that the Danish Constitution should continue to apply throughout the realm, just as Danish should be preserved as a common language for the whole realm. This rather explicit Danish position on Faroese politics provoked Sjálvstýrisflokkurin so much that the party decided to change its platform in 1924. Thus, any reference to Denmark and Danish was removed, incl. the wording that they would work for as much self-government as they could achieve »on the best of terms with the Danish Government and the Danish Rigsdag«.

Cooperation since replaced conflict, but it is part of the story that Sjálvstyrisflokkurin never had a majority of voters behind it. It was the electoral system related to the electoral act for the Løgting and the dean, who supported independence, that in the period 1918‑23 had guaranteed Sjálvstýrisflokkurin a majority in the Løgting. When the new Løgting act, which ensured a fairer electoral law, came into force in 1923, Sambandsflokkurin regained a solid majority in the Løgting that same year. When the Danish Minister for Education, Nina Bang, proposed a compromise which, with a few exceptions, would recognise Faroese as the language of instruction, it was thus rejected by the majority in the Løgting.

The matter was not resolved until 1939, when the Danish Government acknowledged the wish of a large majority of the Løgting from 1936 to rank Faroese alongside Danish in schools and churches. By this time, two new political parties, Javnaðarflokkurin (The Social Democratic Party, 1925) and Vinnuflokkurin (The Business Party, 1935), both of which were more nationalistic than Sambandsflokkurin, had representatives in the Løgting, and Sambandsflokkurin had definitively lost its majority. In 1939, Sjálvstýrisflokkurin was split up, and its chairman, Jóannes Patursson, together with the people behind Vinnuflokkurin established the party Fólkaflokkurin, whose platform was one of political and economic independence.





The period during and after World War II


The first redoubt in Tórshavn was built in approx. 1580 by Magnus Heinason. After World War II, when British soldiers made changes in connection with the occupation, the redoubt was restored to the layout it had after around 1794.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 During World War II, when Denmark was occupied by the Germans and the Faroe Islands by the British on 9 and 13 April 1940, respectively, Sambandsflokkurin had eight members in the Løgting, Javnaðarflokkurin six, Sjálvstýrisflokkurin four and Fólkaflokkurin six. Already on 9 April, Fólkaflokkurin proposed that the Løgting took over all authority in the Faroe Islands, but on 9 May, the majority (18) together with the chief administrative officer adopted a temporary government administration, under which the Løgting together with the chief administrative officer assumed legislative power over the special Faroese matters.

The British occupation recognised the Faroese flag for use at sea, which had the subject of much political debate in the 1930s. From the very beginning, however, the British, who at one point had 8,000 soldiers stationed in the Faroe Islands, made it clear that they wanted to hand the Faroe Islands back to Denmark after the war. At the same time, they declared that they would not recognise the proclamation of an independent Faroese state without prior negotiations with an unoccupied Denmark. Fólkaflokkurin, which in 1943 doubled its mandates in the Løgting from six to 12 and was only one mandate short of having an absolute majority, could therefore not use the voter support for anything.

A Scottish regiment led by bagpipers marches on Áarvegur in Tórshavn on 16 April 1940. During World War II, the Faroe Islands were occupied by England, which left its mark on the islands.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK After the war, however, most people realised that it would be impossible to return to how things were before the war. The Faroese economy was strong, the Løgting, together with the chief administrative officer, had held the legislative authority, the flag was recognised for use at sea, and the Faroese, due to the close economic relationship with the British, had used their own banknotes, which had been linked to the pound sterling, not the Danish kroner; the independence movement stood stronger than ever before.

A general election in November 1945 did not make the political situation any clearer, but when the Faroese political parties were unable to reach an agreement on a new system during negotiations in Copenhagen at the beginning of 1946, the Danish Government put forward a proposal which was in the nature of an ultimatum. None of the political parties were pleased with the proposal, which aimed somewhere between the wishes of the social democrats and the unionists. The intention was probably that social democrats and unionists, who had a narrow majority in the Løgting, would adopt the proposal, but when one social democrat declared himself a supporter of independence, that plan was no longer feasible. Instead, Fólkafokkurin, which wanted an independent Faroe Islands in union with Denmark, proposed a Faroese referendum for or against the Danish Government’s proposal. However, Javnaðarflokkurin and Sambandsflokkurin instead adopted a referendum where the people were asked to choose between the Danish Government’s proposal or secession. The referendum took place on 14 September 1946 and the result was a narrow majority in favour of secession. But when representative from Fólkafokkurin, together with the social democrat defector, wanted to implement the result, the Danish king dissolved the Løgting and called for a new election, which took place in November 1946. The union parties (Sambandsflokkurin, Javnaðarflokkurin and Sjálvstýrisflokkurin) now gained a solid majority in the Løgting, and they initiated new negotiations with the Danish Government where they reached agreement on the Home Rule Act of 1 April 1948, an arrangement with which the social democrats were probably most satisfied.





Home rule


The first home rule government in 1948 was a coalition between Sjálvstýrisflokkurin, Javnaðarflokkurin and Sambandsflokkurin under the leadership of Sambandsflokkurin’s chairman, Andreas Samuelsen, as the first prime minister. However, the Faroese Government only lasted for until 1950, at which point it was replaced by a new government.

Despite fundamental disagreements in the previous years about the relationship with Denmark, the crisis in the 1950s made Fólkaflokkurin and Sambandsflokkurin, which could easily agree on the economic policy, enter into a coalition agreement on a national government cooperation already in 1950, which lasted through most of the 1950s. However, the cooperation with Sambandsflokkurin on the economic policy and with the Danish Government on the rebuilding of the Faroese economy and the fishing industry would cost Fólkaflokkurin dearly. In 1943, the party had 12 seats in the Løgting, and by the end of the 1950s the number had been reduced to five. It was especially the newly established republican party Tjóðveldi (1948) that benefitted from the weakened Fólkafokkurin.

Fishermen, who in the 1950s went on strike to get better conditions, shunned Fólkafokkurin, which was supported by, among others, the shipowners. Instead, many of them voted for the left-wing Tjóðveldi, whose chairman was also chairman of the fishermen’s union. Furthermore, following the referendum in 1946, which they believed Fólkafokkurin had betrayed, Tjóðveldi pointed out that the Home Rule Act allowed Denmark to implement the NATO Treaty of 1949 in the Faroe Islands without asking the Løgting. Last but not least, Tjóðveldi benefitted from the doctor’s conflict in Klaksvík 1952‑56.

By 1958, Tjóðveldi had become one of the four major political parties, along with Sambandsflokkurin, Javnaðarflokkurin and Fólkaflokkurin. They are still the main parties in the Faroe Islands. In 1963, Tjóðveldi joined the Faroese Government for the first time together with Fólkaflokkurin and Sjálvstýrisflokkurin; a government that had big plans within the area of self-government. However, it was not until the 1970s that significant changes started happening in this area.





The doctors’ conflict 1952-56


In 1952 the so-called Klaksvík conflict broke out. The complex matter actually consisted of three conflicts: firstly, a conflict between the new administrative home rule capital Tórshavn and the fishing capital Klaksvík; secondly, a conflict between the fishermen in Klaksvík and the dominant shipowner in the town, Jógvan Frederik Kjølbro, with whom they were in conflict, and thirdly, a conflict between Denmark and the Faroe Islands, especially Klaksvík, where more than 70 % of the voters had voted for independence in September 1946.





Olaf Halvorsen and his supporters


At the quayside in Klaksvík on 21 April 1955. After a failed enforcement procedure, where Olaf Halvorsen was to be deposed, the delegation was chased through town and aboard the passenger ship Tjaldur, where the gangway was removed and the ropes cut.

RITZAU SCANPIX The immediate cause of the dispute was that the management of the overall Faroese hospital system had in 1952 appointed a Faroese hospital doctor at the local hospital in Klaksvík instead of the temporarily appointed Danish doctor, Olaf Halvorsen, who was preferred by the overwhelming majority of the population of the medical district. The appointment led to violent protests from the majority of people in the hospital district, which included the northern islands as well as part of Eysturoy.

From the perspective of the authorities, the problem was that Olaf Halvorsen had ad been a member of the Danish Nazi Party, DNSAP, from 1938 to 1941, and in that context he was given a serious reprimand in 1948 by an arbitration court under DADL (the Danish Medical Association), which also included the Faroese medical association, for his national conditions during the war. The arbitration court also decided that Olaf Halvorsen should pay the costs of the case of DKK 601.50. But when Halvorsen refused to pay, he was excluded from the medical association. According to the agreement between the Danish Health Authority and DADL, he could therefore not be appointed as a hospital doctor at a hospital with health insurance practice, as was the case in Klaksvík.

As a result, the protests from the people were not met. Also, it would most likely not have been possible to cancel the lawful appointment of the Faroese doctor, Eivind Rubek Nielsen. The strong medical association also opposed to any disregard of the lawful appointment of one of the association’s members and refused to appoint a doctor who was not a member of the association, and who, according to the collective agreement, did not meet the conditions for practicing as a hospital doctor.

In this stalemate, the conflict escalated. Olaf Halvorsen stayed at the hospital in Klaksvík, where he was paid by a health fund established by his supporters in Klaksvík. At the same time, the same people physically prevented Eivind Rubek Nielsen from coming ashore from the ship on which he arrived to the town. When the highest authorities (the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands, chief medical officer, chief of police and government members) tried to remove Olaf Halvorsen from his position, they were prevented from doing so or even ordered out of Klaksvík.





The Danish intervention

JACOB MAARBJERG/RITZAU SCANPIX After more than two years with no prospect of solving the conflict, the authorities in Tórshavn gave up. In April 1955, a helpless Faroese Government asked the Danish government for police assistance to restore law and order in Klaksvík.

After the Danish government had sent the DFDS ship Parkeston to the Faroe Islands with 120 police officers and dogs, the Danish Minister of Finance Viggo Kampmann managed to get approval for a settlement. However, Parkeston did not manage to call at Klaksvík Port, which was barricaded. The settlement meant that Olaf Halvorsen had to leave the hospital for the time being, while two Danish doctors were temporarily appointed for six months. The time was to be spend amending the rules for the employment of doctors so that Olaf Halvorsen could practice as a hospital doctor in Klaksvík.

Peace was restored in Klaksvík, but since the authorities had still not managed to implement significant parts of the settlement in September, it became necessary for the hospital board to appoint new doctors, which took place at a meeting on 27 September 1955. However, even before this meeting was held, some of Halvorsen’s supporters had suspected that the real intention was not for Halvorsen, who had left the Faroe Islands in May, to return. When the members of the hospital board, including the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands and the chief medical officer, were to travel by ship to Tórshavn after the meeting, they were surrounded by angry citizens down at the harbour who forced them to seek shelter at the police station. The result was that the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands called the Danish Prime Minister H.C. Hansen and told him that he was being held hostage in Klaksvík.

In the morning, the hospital board was allowed to leave the police station, but by then the Danish government had decided to send the frigate Rolf Krake to the Faroe Islands with 164 marines and police officers. Rolf Krake arrived in Klaksvík on 1 October 1955. This triggered violent unrest, but after a few months, the Danish superpower managed to restore law and order in the town, although not without resistance. In October and November, electricity went off regularly due to sabotage, bombs were detonated in houses, and in November a bomb was detonated at the police station where four police officers were staying. However, no one was seriously injured. No one was ever charged with the bombings, but in 2021, one of the bombers revealed his identity. However, many were arrested and charged with other offences. Harbour master Fischer Heinesen, who had been the leader of the Olaf Halvorsen supporters, received the harshest sentence of 12 months in 1956.

Not until February 1956 did the last Danish police officers and the frigate Holger Danske leave Klaksvík.





Causes of the conflict

RITZAU SCANPIX While the immediate cause of the conflict was the appointment of a doctor, the underlying causes were deeper. The doctor’s conflict was based on socio-political conditions in Klaksvík, a centre-periphery conflict in the Faroe Islands and a political conflict with Denmark, which escalated when Danish warships were sent to Klaksvík.

Firstly, with a narrow majority, the Faroese had voted for secession from Denmark in a referendum in 1946. Many were disappointed when the result was only home rule, but in Klaksvík, where the majority had been quite convincing (70.6 %), great disappointment was seen. Furthermore, many believed that with the Home Rule Act of 1948, political and administrative power had been concentrated in the capital, Tórshavn. The main reason why the hospital came into focus was that the town’s first hospital had been established in 1898 based on local initiative and responsibility. When the new hospital was built in 1928, funding came from the Løgting and the state. With the Hospital Act in 1939, the Faroese Government and the state therefore took over responsibility for the local hospital, which many in Klaksvík believed had been neglected while the central hospital in Tórshavn had been given priority.

In addition to the underlying potential for conflicts between Klaksvík and Tórshavn and Denmark, respectively, there was a local conflict in Klaksvík. In the 1950s, the town’s and the Faroe Islands’ largest employer, Jógvan Frederik Kjølbro, was involved in several major labour market disputes with the fishermen’s association, whose chairman was Erlendur Patursson. Patursson was also the leader of Tjóðveldi (Republicans), which was particularly strong in Klaksvík. Kjølbro had not supported Halvorsen and his followers – quite the contrary. And the riots were often directly aimed at the Kjølbro family. Part of the story is that the doctor Eivind Rubek Nielsen and Evald Kjølbro, Jógvan Frederik Kjølbro’s son, were brothers-in-law. The doctor’s conflict was part of a rebellion against the Kjølbro family, both on the personal and political level.





The aftermath


Olaf Halvorsen never came back to the Faroe Islands, but in Klaksvík the citizens were pleased that Eivind Rubek Nielsen eventually did not want to take up the position of doctor. The hospital also got its own hospital board, which it only partially managed to abolish in 2018.

The doctor’s conflict consolidated the strong local dimension in Faroese politics. It also consolidated the Danish governments’ anxiety about Faroese relations, and the dispute strengthened – at least for some time – the secession-oriented dimension in Faroese politics.

1970-2007 on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	The years from 1970 to 2007 mark a new period in the relationship between Denmark and the Faroe Islands. The Home Rule Act had not created calm in the often quite tumultuous relations between Denmark and the Faroe Islands, but it had given the Faroe Islands the opportunity to take care of the Faroe Islands’ interests within some wide boundaries.

The period of home rule had begun with a series of the Faroe Islands taking over a number of areas, but since then, takeovers had few and far between, even when independence parties were in power. However, the period from 1970 to 2007 saw the beginning of some new takeovers, but ended with the most turbulent period to date.





Position in the kingdom and administration

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 In 1970, Denmark adopted the Municipal Reform, which it also had an impact on the Faroe Islands. In connection with the reform, hospitals, public welfare and schools were some of the areas outsourced to the Danish county municipalities, and the state subsidies to the municipalities were since changed to an annually agreed block grant.

During the first years of its existence, the Faroese home rule had taken over several areas from list A and a few from list B. But it was usually areas that were easy to manage and economically easy to take over. This had also been the case in the years 1963‑67, when a coalition of independence parties was in power.

In 1990, the Faroe Islands became an independent diocese, and Havnar Kirkja in Tórshavn became the cathedral of the Faroe Islands. The photo shows a confirmation in the church in 2007, the same year that the Evangelical Lutheran Church passed to home rule.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN Major changes in this field did not happen until after 1975, when the socalled ‘takeover coalition’ under the leadership of Javnaðarflokkurin was organised together with Fólkaflokkurin and Tjóðveldi. Already in 1976, the coalition took over the postal services, which was on list A, since it was expected that sale of Faroese stamps would make the takeover a reasonable business. But list A also included hospitals, public welfare and schools. The challenge was that these extremely important welfare areas were not only administratively heavy, they were also extremely challenging to take over from an economic perspective.

The Faroese Government was therefore not able to take over responsibility for these areas under section 2 of the Home Rule Act. But after the Municipal Reform in 1970, the Danish authorities were very keen on finding a similar arrangement for the Faroe Islands as for the Danish county municipalities. Therefore, focus was aimed at section 9 of the Home Rule Act, which made it possible for the home rule and the Danish Government to agree on the extent to which a policy area should be taken over. In this case, the agreement was that the home rule should take over authority to issue executive orders within these areas, while the treasury still had to cover the expenses it had incurred in the area. Already in 1975, the home rule took over parts of public welfare, including the pension area, under section 9. In 1976, parts of the health sector was transferred in the same way, and in 1979, the school area was also taken over under section 9. Later, other parts of these welfare areas were also taken over by the home rule. Regardless of the fact that the Faroese Government did not take over full economic responsibility for all the areas, it became necessary to build a strong administrative machinery.

In 1992, the Danish Government and the Faroese Government agreed that the home rule should take over the policy area of underground deposits of raw materials from list B subject to section 2, and since then the Løgting has been fully responsible for the area.

The financing of the areas on lists A and B, which had still not been transferred, had usually implied that the Faroese Government paid half, while the treasury, through a reimbursement scheme, paid the other half of the expenses. In connection with the takeover of these areas, which the Danish state still had to finance, the Danish Government wanted the state subsidy to be changed to a pre-agreed block grant as was the case in Denmark. This scheme was introduced in the Faroe Islands in 1988, and since then the Faroese Government and the Danish Government have agreed the size of the grant in the year or years to come in advance. After this, the Danish state no longer reimbursed expenses incurred for these areas; instead, the Danish Government transferred the agreed amount to the home rule, which could thus freely dispose of the amount according to the Faroese Finance Act.

The organisation of the Faroese society’s administrative system had been established in 1948 based on a society where most areas were administered under a Danish system. However, with the many takeovers in the 1970s, it became problematic to maintain a comprehensive administration without a clear distribution of responsibilities between the areas.

In 1995, the Løgting therefore established a new administration system, which at the political level introduced a clear division of responsibility between the members of the Faroese Government and ministerial responsibility for the individual members of Faroese Government.

At the same time, negative parliamentarism, which had not been part of the political system, was introduced. Accordingly, the Løgting could, with a majority of all members, unseat a member of the Faroese Government, the prime minister, or dissolve the entire Faroese Government. Furthermore, you would no longer be able to sit in both the Løgting and the Faroese Government. The Løgting’s control over the Faroese Government was thus strengthened, while, at the same time, the prime minister – not the Løgting as before – was charged with appointing the members of the Faroese Government, whom he could now also remove. A week after a vote of no confidence, the prime minister retained the authority to call new elections for the Løgting. At the same time, separate ministries were established under each of the members of the Faroese Government, which from 1948 to the 1970s had grown from three to seven, with responsibility for their respective areas and institutions.

In 2002, the school area and public welfare were taken over again, but this time subject to section 2, and the areas thus became the responsibility of the home rule in terms of both legislation and financing. The hospital sector has still not been taken over again by the home rule subject to section 2. However, the difference between the partial section 9 and full section 2 takeovers has, with the conversion of the state subsidy into block grants, become less significant for the home rule’s actual responsibility and latitude regarding areas taken over subject to section 9, since, with the conversion, the Løgting has otherwise gained full economic responsibility for the hospital sector.

The Home Rule Act is still in force, but an amendment in 2005 meant that the areas on list B, which require agreement between the parties to be taken over, were abolished. And instead of a positive list of the policy areas that could be taken over, a positive list was drawn up of the policy areas that were not included: the constitution, citizenship, the Supreme Court, foreign, security and defence policy as well as currency and monetary policy, which are Danish areas of responsibility. Apart from these policy areas, the home rule decides whether an area is to be taken over and negotiates with the Danish Government about the timing of the takeover.





Municipalities


The number of Faroese municipalities remained stable at 51 from 1970 to 2004, when the number was significantly reduced to 30 in 2008 and later again to the current 29. The intention was to reach a number of eight-nine evenly sized municipalities that would be able to take on major tasks from the Faroese Government, but the municipal mergers were carried out voluntarily and without any overall plan. The result is that there are fewer municipalities, but they are very different in size, from Tórshavn, which covers a quarter of the population, to very small villages. The Faroese Government has therefore had to enforce cross-municipal cooperation in connection with the outsourcing of heavy tasks such as old-age care to the municipalities. Contrary to the intention, a new administrative link has thus been established between the Faroese Government and some of the municipalities. At the same time, the democratic supervision of these cross-municipal units is much less than in the Løgting and in the actual democratically elected municipal councils.





The Evangelical Lutheran Church


The Evangelical Lutheran Church, which had been under the Diocese of Copenhagen since 1923, was taken over from list B in the Home Rule Act on ólavsøka in 2007, following political negotiations between the home rule and the Danish Government.





Business and population


Tourism has grown in the Faroe Islands and every year, many large cruise ships call at Tórshavn and some other ports for a short stays.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 At 95 %, fishery products continued to be the dominant export product, but the fishing industry underwent major changes during the crisis of the 1990s, when subsidy schemes for the industry were phased out. The profitable shrimp fishery off Greenland became vital during the 1970s but has been in decline in recent years. The pelagic fishery gained great importance for the economy towards the end of the period, while the number of filleting factories, on the other hand, was greatly reduced due to the crisis in the 1990s.

A new business, salmon farming, emerged at the beginning of the period. In 1993, disease and expensive loans threatened the industry, which, however, survived and became vital to the Faroese economy until 2000, when it came under serious threat again, this time by the ILA disease among the salmon populations. However, ILA was overcome, and now salmon farming constitutes a large part of the Faroe Islands’ exports.

The population increased from around 38,000 in 1970 to around 48,600 in 2010, but the growth was not steady. Already at the beginning of the 1990s, the population was at the same level as in 2010, but the crisis in the 1990s meant that about 13 % of the population moved from the Faroe Islands, and it was not until the end of the period that the population had reached the same level as in the early 1990s. The large population growth and population concentration took place in Tórshavnar Kommuna, where approx. 40 % of the population lived in 2010, while Runavíkar Kommuna on the eastern side of Skálafjørður had 7.8 % of the population in 2010. Klaksvík remained relatively stable with approx. 10 % of the population, while Suðuroy, Sandoy and the sparsely populated and remote islands experienced a decline in population.





Infrastructure and transport


The undersea tunnel, the Eysturoy Tunnel, was built in the period 2016‑1920 and is the Faroe Islands’ largest structure to date. It connects both sides of Skálafjørður on Eysturoy and Tórshavn on Streymoy. Tróndur Patursson created the artwork that was fitted around the tunnel’s roundabout. The chain of people holding each other’s hands gives associations to the traditional Faroese chain dance, but should, according to the artist, be understood as a broader portrait of Faroese unity as a prerequisite for the development of society. Eyðun Eliasen is the architect behind the portals and the light in the tunnel, which has several colours.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 During the period from 1970 to 2007, the physical connection between the islands underwent a real revolution. The first bridge between islands in the Faroe Islands was opened in 1973 when the bridge between Streymoy and Eysturoy opened. This bridge link connected the two largest islands, and three years later – in 1976 – the tunnel opened from Norðskála with a connection to Skálafjørður and north to Fuglafjørður and Leirvík, where there was a ferry service to Klaksvík. It was now possible to drive from Tórshavn over Oyggjarvegin and via the new bridge to Skálafjørður or Leirvík and on by ferry to Klaksvík and the islands to the north. In 1992, the Kaldbak Tunnel opened, making it unnecessary to drive over Oyggjarvegin to Skálafjørður.

The infrastructure was also expanded in Norðoyggjar. From 1979 to 1985, four tunnels were opened on Kalsoy between the four villages on Kalsoy, from which there was a ferry service from Syðradalur to Klaksvík. On the neighbouring island of Kunoy, a new tunnel connected the two villages on Kunoy in 1988, and since 1986, there has been a direct road from Haraldssund over a dam to Klaksvík and the villages to the north. In 1974, a dam across Hvannasund connected the islands of Borðoy and Viðoy, from which there was a road – which in 2016 was replaced by a tunnel – north to Viðareiði. In 1974, a modern car ferry service was established between Klaksvík and Leirvík, which was the main connection to the rest of the country until 2007, when a tunnel under Leirvíksfjørður connected Klaksvík and Norðoyggjar with a fixed road to Eysturoy and on to Streymoy.

Before that, in 2002, the first undersea tunnel in the Faroe Islands was opened between Streymoy and Vágar, where an airfield that the British had originally built during World War II since the 1960s had become the main connection between the Faroe Islands and the rest of the world with several daily flights to Denmark and other destinations. From Tórshavn, in particular, there are almost daily services to Denmark and Iceland with cargo ships and car ferries.

An undersea tunnel between Sandoy and Streymoy is under way (expected to open for traffic in 2023). Suðuroy, on which a tunnel between Ørðavík and Hov was opened in 2007, is the only major island not connected by a fixed road to the rest of the Faroe Islands. An undersea tunnel from 2020 between the densely populated area at Skálafjørður and Tórshavn has linked these areas closely together.





School and education


Newly minted high school graduates from Miðnám í Kambsdali celebrate the day on the beach in Syðrugøta on 22 June 2021.

JESPER HOUBORG/RITZAU SCANPIX In 1974, an alternative to the three year high school was introduced, the two-year higher preparatory course, which gave students with a 10th grade exam access and the possibility of being admitted to a higher education. It started in Hoydalar, but as something new also outside Tórshavn, namely in Klaksvík and on Suðuroy and in 1980, also in Gøtugjógv on Eysturoy. In 1982, a new high school and higher preparatory centre was established on Eysturoy, which also included the higher preparatory courses in Klaksvík, while the higher preparatory course in Suðuroy was part of the course in Hoydalar. Since then, other high school-level programmes have been started, such as a special fishery-based high school programme in Vestmanna.

In 1979, the system with two threeyear tracks after 7th grade, the lower secondary school leaving examination and grades 8‑10, respectively, changed entirely; and the lower secondary school leaving examination was abolished.

In 1976, the first stage in the construction of a new technical school in Klaksvík was inaugurated, and it was completed in 1989 and was able to offer programmes in machinery, carpentry and electricity. The technical school in Klaksvík, which has since been expanded, has since 1992 also been offering a combined technical and high school programme. In 2009, a new high school in Hov on Suðuroy, which was also to house the Faroe Islands Health School, was inaugurated; in 2018, a new high school in Tórshavn, Glasir – Tórshavn College, was opened.

Fróðskaparsetur Føroya (University of the Faroe Islands) was established as an academy in 1965. Initially, only a single academic was employed at the university, a professor of Faroese, but in 1972 a natural science department was added, and in the period 1982‑92, the university also had a history and social science department. In 2008, the teachers’ school and the nursing school merged with the university.





Politics


The large hall in the Nordic House in Tórshavn formed the setting for the final party leaders’ debate on 20 January 2004 before the upcoming general election.

THOMAS BORBERG/RITZAU SCANPIX The 1970s ushered in a new era in Faroese politics with the takeover of administratively heavy policy areas, and the period ended with some tumultuous years in the relationship between Denmark and the Faroe Islands. In addition to the significant takeovers, the Faroese Government also had to deal with major changes in the international arena. The oil crisis in 1973 created great unrest around the export-oriented fishing industry, and at the same time, Denmark became a member of the European Community. The Faroe Islands, which, by virtue of its home rule status, were allowed to take an independent position on membership, chose to remain outside the European Community because of the fishing industry. The background was that the coastal nations would be able to place the limit of the territorial waters at 200 nautical miles, which would mean that Faroese fishing vessels would be cut off from fishing in the territorial waters of other coastal nations in the same way as other countries’ fishing vessels would be cut off from Faroese territorial waters. In 1977, the Løgting, in agreement with other coastal nations, decided to move the Faroese limit of the territorial waters from 12 to 200 nautical miles.





The Raw Fish Fund


Against this background, the Faroese Government introduced the so-called Raw Fish Fund in 1975, the purpose of which was to defend the Faroese fishing industry against the sharp fluctuations in prices for fish and oil on the world market. However, the fund also became very important for the transition of the fishing industry to the new international conditions. The idea was that those who fished and sold highly priced fish species on the world market should pay part of their profit to the Raw Fish Fund; those who fished and sold low priced fish species on the world market would then get funding from the fund. The fund was to be managed by a board which represented all parties in the fishing industry and the Faroese Government, and it was to be non-profit. Any loss would have to be carried by the Faroese Government. However, one consequence of the fund and the funding schemes was that the fishing industry did not adapt to market terms, in fact it became more dependent on funding from the fund.

During the 1980s, the fund and the funding schemes ended up costing the Faroese taxpayers DKK 6 billion. In addition, ships were often built with guarantees from the national treasury and often without equity. Despite the fact that this generated record foreign debt, there was no shortage of capital in the Faroe Islands. An interest act from the 1950s, which exempted interest income from tax, meant that it would pay off to borrow money and put them in the bank. As the same act meant that the deposit rate in the Faroe Islands was higher than the lending rate in Denmark, foreign capital began to flow into the Faroese banks in the 1980s. Deposits increased from DKK 2 to 7 billion during the 1980s, and the banks had no other option than to lend the money to Faroese who were unable to take out cheap foreign loans. On top of this, the Faroese Government pursued an expansionist fiscal policy with large deficits of DKK 300‑400 million on the Budget. The advisory committee of the Danish Prime Minister’s office warned the Faroese Government every year, but it did nothing to redress the economy – at least not until it was too late.





The economic crisis from 1992


In 1990, it the Faroese Government, which was no longer able to take out loans, was forced to wind up the Raw Fish Fund, resulting in bankruptcies. The national treasury guarantees became effective and converted private debt in the order of DKK 1.6 billion into additional public debt. The crisis became a reality when fishing decreased partly due to overfishing of the fish populations, partly because fish prices plummeted. Loans were cancelled, and the Faroese banks, as in the 1950s, were in dire straits. On Saturday 3 October 1992, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority demanded that the Faroese-owned SJóvinnubankin should raise new capital of DKK 500 million if the bank were to open again on Monday 5 October. The bank’s management first turned to the Faroese shareholders, who were unable to raise new capital, and then to the Faroese Government, which was also unable to borrow the capital needed. In a hurry, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister went to Copenhagen to negotiate with the Danish Government.

On 6 October, the agreement between the Danish Government and the Faroese Government was made public. The Danish Government wanted to lend the Faroese Government DKK 500 million to put in the bank, but the conditions for the help were tough. Finansieringsfonden af 1992, a financing fund, was established with five members; three were elected by the Danish Government, including the chairman, and two by the Faroese Government, including the deputy chairman. The loans and the conditions that the Danish Government made for the recovery of the Faroese economy were to be administered by the fund. In fact, the Faroe Islands were put under administration.

The other large bank, Føroya Banki, also needed new capital, but since the bank’s main shareholder was the large Danske Bank, the obligation was with this bank. Danske Bank injected DKK 332 million into Føroya Banki. But the management proposed to Finansieringsfonden to make a share exchange with the Faroese Government in relation to Sjóvinnubankin, of which the Faroese Government was now the main shareholder, so that the Faroese Government would become the main shareholder of both banks. Danske Bank argued that it was anti-competitive that one bank was injected with public capital while the other was injected with new private capital. It would be an advantage for the Danish national authorities and Finansieringsfonden if the entire Faroese banking sector came under the control of the authorities.

In 1993, Finansieringsfonden presented an agreement on such a share exchange, which the Danish Government, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority and Danske Bank all agreed to. However, the Faroese Government, which would then have sole responsibility for both banks after a share exchange, had doubts. At a meeting in Copenhagen on 17 March 1993, Prime Minister Marita Petersen asked the Chief Executive Officer of Danske Bank, Peter Straarup, if Føroya Banki needed more capital. Straarup responded that it did not need more capital, and that a share exchange would be advantageous for the Faroese Government. It was based on this promise that the Faroese Government approved the share exchange on 22 March 1993. However, Straarup was unable to keep his promise.

Just two weeks after the share exchange, Føroya Banki was informed by the Financial Supervisory Authority in Copenhagen that the bank did not meet the capital adequacy requirement of the Danish Banking Act. So in September 1993, the Faroese Government had to take out a loan from the Danish Government of DKK 1.2 billion to be placed in the bank via Finansieringsfonden.

The Faroese population initially accepted the measures, but the terms were tough. In the years 1993‑95, unemployment rose to over 20 %, many had to leave their home, and about 13 % of the population moved from the Faroe Islands, mostly to Denmark. The population also had to put up with an 8 % wage cut. However, critical voices began to emerge in 1994‑95. And in 1995, a unanimous Løgting decided to demand that the Danish Government set up a judicial inquiry of the share exchange. A commission was set up and submitted a report in 1998. The commission sharply criticised the Danish Government, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority and Danske Bank and concluded that the Faroese Government had acquired a bank in 1993 about which it had not received all the relevant information beforehand.





The aftermath of the crisis


In 1998, the Danish Government entered into an agreement with the Faroese Government to compensate it for the share exchange, however, the same year, Faroe Islands elected a majority of independence supporters consisting of Tjóðveldi, Fólkaflokkurin and Sjálvstýrisflokkurin into the Løgting. The parties entered into a coalition agreement with the aim of establishing the Faroe Islands as a sovereign state in personal union with Denmark. The Faroese Government prepared negotiations with the Danish Government on an interim arrangement and a Faroese constitution. The intention was that the referendum should be on the interim arrangement and the Constitution.

The Faroese Government’s starting point for the negotiations with the Danish Government, which began in 2000, was an interim arrangement of 15 years to phase out the annual block grant of almost DKK 1 billion. However, it turned out that the Danish Government would not accept an economic interim arrangement of more than four years. After four futile negotiations in Copenhagen, the negotiations ended without an agreement. After political unrest in the Faroese Government, the prime minister decided to cancel the referendum, which was scheduled to take place in 2001. Instead, the Faroese Government decided in 2002 to take over schools and public welfare in accordance with section 2 of the Home Rule Act, and it initiated the first and largest reduction of the block grant, which, at a stroke, was reduced by DKK 366 million to DKK 626 million.

The independence coalition continued until 2004 with the support of a small centre party. Since then, there has been general consensus that the block grant must be maintained at the level at which it has ended up. No political agreement has been reached on further takeovers with a corresponding reduction of the block grant, but the question of a constitution has regularly been on the political agenda.

Visual arts on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Sámal Joensen-Mikines’ poignant depiction of mourners on their way home from a funeral, Aftur av jarðarferð from 1937, is iconic of Faroese painting. THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF THE FAROE ISLANDS Faroese visual art has undergone a rapid development, which has gained particular momentum since the turn of the millennium. After the late start of visual art in the early 1900s, Faroese art could for a long time be explained and defined quite narrowly as a modernist and nature-loving form of expression, which often resulted in colourist landscape painting. However, it has gradually become more varied and is expressed in several art forms. The landscape still has a dominant position in traditional painting and in the progressive form experiments.

Niels Kruse, Jógvan Waagstein and Kristin í Geil were self-taught visual artists and they were some of the founders of Faroese landscape painting. It seems that Kruse was encouraged to paint by the American explorer Elisabeth Taylor, who stayed for a period in the Faroe Islands. Here she also became acquainted with the Danish visual artist Flora Heilmann and the author Mikkkjal Dánjalsson á Ryggi. Kruse is the most romantic of the three pioneers; he focuses especially on the idyll of the home village in sunset paintings. In Jógvan Waagstein’s paintings, a naturalistic interest can be felt in relation to the country’s topography, while Kristin í Geil focuses on traditions in his paintings. Flora Heilmann was a vicar’s wife at Viðareiði for ten years and repeatedly returned to the Faroe Islands where she painted 57 watercolours of old houses, churches and other motifs of cultural-historical significance, which were donated to the library in Tórshavn. The first Faroese visual artist with higher education was Bergithe Johannessen, who studied in London and Copenhagen, and who painted light landscape watercolours and earned a living as a porcelain painter at the Royal Porcelain Factory in Copenhagen.





Professionalisation of visual arts


The author and visual artist William Heinesen achieved international fame and was a key figure in Faroese cultural life in the mid-20th century. PER PEJSTRUP/RITZAU SCANPIX, 1970 Sámal Joensen-Mikines was the first to work professionally with visual art and is thus perceived as the father of Faroese visual art. He strikes a dark, expressive tone that still resonates with contemporary artists such as Øssur Johannesen and others. Mikines studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen in the years 1928‑34 under professors Ejnar Nielsen and Aksel Jørgensen, where the former in particular became very important to him both as a mentor and as a friend. Mikines’ works from the 1930s revolves thematically around illness and death, partly inspired by personal losses and experiences, but also by the symbolicexpressive paintings of Norwegian Edvard Munch. The major work Aftur av jarðarferð (Return from funeral, 1937), which is exhibited at Listasavn Føroya (National Gallery of the Faroe Islands), summarises Mikines’ efforts with melancholic, dark images of death as a universal condition and the resulting grief and loss. Later, the expression became brighter and looser with motifs such as pilot whale hunt, Faroese dance, sea scenes and landscapes. His painting style was partly dramatic and unrestrained, partly clarified and modernistically rigorous.

One of the central figures in the emerging Faroese art community was William Heinesen, who in addition to his writing was a curator, critic and visual artist. He engaged in and refined papercut in a series of colourful works, several of which are owned by Listasavn Føroya. He helped decorate the school, Tórshavnar kommunuskúli, which was inaugurated in 1956, together with Janus Kamban and Zacharias Heinesen. The artwork has been preserved and can still be seen, even though the school has been closed and is now partly used for artist studios. Janus Kamban’s large cement relief on the facade, Søgumaðurin (The Storyteller) (1957), has the same simple and clear expression of form that is seen in his sculptures around the Faroe Islands with motifs from everyday life and daily work. His graphic works are also simple like perfectly formed vignettes.

Sámal Joensen-Mikines’ painting Dansen (The Dance) from 1944. Oil on canvas. The image reproduces the movement and engagement in the content of the ballad seen in the chain dance. The dance does not take place in a circle but is more like a kind of moving labyrinth. And often it is best, if it gets a bit cramped. THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF THE FAROE ISLANDS William Heinesen has described how difficult it was to get hold of works by Ruth Smith for exhibitions, as she was unusually self-critical and constantly in doubt about her own achievements. With her, it is mainly about observing and following Aksel Jørgensen’s advice to ‘bring out the colours’, which she successfully manages to do in her impressionistic and light-saturated landscape sketches. The expression is rather expressive in the colourist self-portraits from the 1950s, in which she has paid particular attention to the eyes and the area around them. They are built up by multi-coloured, short brushstrokes that make the image surface vibrate with life.





The landscape as a motif


The first generation of trained visual artists returned home from Copenhagen after World War II, and among them was Ingálvur av Reyni, whose works constitute the next great modernist breakthrough in Faroese art. He began with figurative, strongly colourist paintings with an emphasis on complementary colours, as he had learned at the academy. However, under the guidance of the Danish visual artist Jack Kampmann, he gradually learned to master the choice of colours in his progressively more abstract paintings. In 1960, Ingálvur av Reyni made some entirely non-figurative paintings, but then returned to the Faroese landscape, which he interpreted in huge, abstract compositions with and without figures. It was mainly in later years that he achieved a new colouristic and compositional freedom in magnificent, expressive masterpieces. One of these works has a prominent place behind the rostrum in the Løgting chamber.

Steffan Danielsen was a self-taught loner and his choice of motifs and compositions are unorthodox and original with an unwavering sense of loneliness. In contrast, both mood and colours are brighter and lighter in Frimod Joensen’s naïve paintings of people and animals and their surroundings, which he painted in a refreshingly cheerful manner. Thomas Arge had a special take on the Faroese landscape, which he depicted up close with an almost tactile feel for the moss, stones and grass.

Ingálvur av Reyni was a colourist painter, which can be seen in this painting from 1956. But he also used the strong colours in more recent major works from the turn of the millennium until his death in 2005. THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF THE FAROE ISLANDS Kunoy painted by the artist Zacharias Heinesen in 1998. The rock formations on the island of Kalsoy can be seen on the other side of the sound. JAKOB SKOU-HANSEN/NATIONAL GALLERY OF DENMARK Rannvá Pálsdóttir Kunoy is one of the seven visual artists who have decorated Glasir – Tórshavn College, in 2018. Her paintings have an ethereal character and change colour depending on the viewer’s position. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021





Abstract painting


Relatively abstract, the expressive interpretations of nature have had and still have many distinguished practitioners, for example, Bárður Jákupsson, whose paintings and watercolours alternate between the powerful, the lyrical and the decorative. He has made several major artworks, and he is one of the most important art communicators. Zacharias Heinesen has been a central figure in Faroese art for decades. His compositions with geometric angular mountains and houses in bright colours have almost set a fashion and have become the very symbol of Faroese visual art. He is basically an impressionist and has a particular interest in the light and materiality of nature.

Anker Mortensen continues Ingálvur av Reyni’s abstract tradition and has produced a number of works on paper in a more avant-garde style. He prefers to work with series of pictures with poetic-sounding titles that emphasise the spirituality of the paintings.

Hansina Iversen and Rannvá Pálsdóttir Kunoy are pioneers of nonfigurative painting, which they have consistently explored since the 1990s. Hansina Iversen’s colouristic paintings and lithographs have a sensual effect on the viewer with compositions that appear harmonious and complex at the same time with small deviations that constantly open up new interpretations. Kunoy’s career has an international dimension with exhibitions in Switzerland and New York. Her paintings appear holographic due to a special multicoloured pigment that makes the painting change colour depending on the viewer’s position.

Ruth Smith’s self-portraits from the 1950s are expressive depictions of the artist’s troubled mind and are among her strongest works. THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF THE FAROE ISLANDS





Christianity and LGBT


One of the strongest colourists is Torbjørn Olsen who, in addition to painting urban spaces, depicts people in expressive portraits. He has painted altarpieces in several Faroese and Danish churches, where he emphasises the biblical drama with complementary colours.

Sigrun Gunnarsdóttir’s style is quite different, naive and symbolic, and she too has painted Christian motifs. Her imagery is simple and centres around a figure, a person, a bird or a tree placed on a plain background. In addition, she places a few things that deepen the portrayal as a kind of props in a scenography with a focus on security and love.

The LGBT movement has made great progress in the Faroe Islands in recent years. A queer artistic expression has grown, and multifaceted artists, such as Robin Ova Tolfsen and Dan Helgi í Gong, comment on and question normality and gender identity.





Art in public spaces


Faroese art decorations have grown in number since Tórshavnar Kommuna passed legislation on art decoration of public buildings in 2007. Not least Edward Fuglø has made out a number of decorations at various schools. One of these is the decoration of Skúlin á Fløtum (2020), which consists of three works whose titles are figurative language used in everyday life: Flogvit, Lesihestur and Oddafiskur. Fuglø has interpreted these terms conceptually and decoratively, but also quite concretely – a reading horse made up of letters and the word flogvit, which means genius and plays on the upward motion of birds’ flight, in the form of stuffed birds on a large ring. Astri Luihn has also decorated several schools, e.g. Skúlin við Streymin (2020), illustrating stories from the Faroese ballads, Sjúrðakvæðini.

Economic prosperity and the associated growing tourism have resulted in a renewed interest in art in the public space, and most self-respecting places have some form of decoration or monument.

A real attraction is Hans Pauli Olsen’s large bronze sculpture The Seal Woman from 2014 mounted on the rocks at the water’s edge at Mikladalur in memory of the legend of the seal woman. Hans Pauli Olsen is the Faroe Islands’ most prolific sculptor, and his figures are modelled in clay with a classic cut. The reason why some of the works are also experienced as surreal is that the position of several figures seems to negate the force of gravity. His sculpture of graphic artist Elinborg Lützen (2020) in Klaksvík is the first statue of a named woman to be erected in the Faroe Islands.

For Tróndur Patursson, art is primarily about conveying a cosmic experience on one of his sea voyages together with Tim Severin. Patursson’s latest work is located far below the surface of the sea in the world’s first undersea roundabout in the Eysturoy Tunnel, which he has decorated with blue, green and red lights. At the base of the column, Patursson has placed an 80 m long Corten Steel screen, which he has carved to look like silhouettes of people standing shoulder to shoulder all the way round as a universal symbol of human togetherness.

Hans Pauli Olsen’s sculpture Seyðamaðurin á Sondum (The Shepherd of Sondum) was unveiled in Sandavágur in 2021. It illustrates the legend of a shepherd who wanted to steal a sorceress’s gown. They fought over the gown, and when it tore at the sleeve, as the church of Sandavágur became visible to the sorceress, she gave up and settled for the rest of the gown. Legend has it that the sleeve was so large that it was made into a chasuble for the church in Sandavágur. JENS KRISTIAN VANG Hans Pauli Olsen’s statue The Seal Woman, standing by the surf and looking towards land, was erected in 2014. It is a significant tourist attraction, but at the same time it has raised questions about representation and symbolism: Should she, in fact, have looked out towards the water and thus turned her back on the village and her abuser instead of turning her gaze towards them? ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 As a businessman, Jógvan Frederik Kjølbro was the most important profile in Klaksvík for several decades. As a member of the Brethren congregation, he also made a strong profile in the spiritual life, but involuntarily came into conflict with parts of the population during the medical dispute in the 1950s. In 2002, the town’s residents erected a sculpture of him by the artist Hans Pauli Olsen outside one of his businesses. CARLO RHIGER, 2018 The undersea tunnel, the Eysturoy Tunnel, was built in the period 2016‑1920 and is the Faroe Islands’ largest structure to date. It connects both sides of Skálafjørður on Eysturoy and Tórshavn on Streymoy. Tróndur Patursson created the artwork that was fitted around the tunnel’s roundabout. The chain of people holding each other’s hands gives associations to the traditional Faroese chain dance, but should, according to the artist, be understood as a broader portrait of Faroese unity as a prerequisite for the development of society. Eyðun Eliasen is the architect behind the portals and the light in the tunnel, which has several colours. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021





Diversity and form experiments


Alda Mohr Eyðunardóttir belongs to the environmentally and climate-conscious young generation. Her sculpture depicted in this photo consists of Faroese wool and stone and has a poetic edge confirmed by the title, which is a poem in itself: to change what was intended/ to tug an oar through the heavy sea/to force the sea to succumb/force it to bow itself/yield to me/clap for me/like the sea that clapped rocks/on its shoulders/while the pilot-whale fog approaches. KINNA POULSEN, 2020 Several of the contemporary artists, for example Tóroddur Poulsen and Hanni Bjartalíð, work with a variety of art forms and with a multitude of abstract and figurative visual elements, which they select and put together. Recent years have been characterised by form experiments and by the tendency for art to also move out of the institutions. Jón Sonni Jensen held his exhibition VISCERA CONSTRUCT (2017) in the premises of a scientific company with organic figures and sculptures made of latex, foam and aluminium. The same rounded shapes characterise Randi Samsonsen’s textile works. A non-figurative materiality can be seen in Jóhan Martin Christiansen’s works, and when he held his first special exhibition at Listasavn Føroya in 2016, he exhibited plaster with specific traces of grass and branches.

Nature is also a theme in many of the young artists’ works. Alda Mohr Eyðunardóttir’s works has ecocritical perspectives, while surrealist and feminist features can be seen in Anný Djurhuus Øssursdóttir’s pop-up exhibitions that she organises out in nature.





Art institutions, art associations and galleries


The oldest part, Listaskálin, of the Listasavn Føroya art gallery was designed by J.P. Gregoriussen and built in 1970. In 1993, the museum was expanded with a new building, designed by Niels F. Truelsen in collaboration with J.P. Gregoriussen. The sculptor Hans Pauli Olsen created the work The Shadow, which can be seen on the right side of the photo. BJARNE JAKOBSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2013 The national gallery Listasavn Føroya is located in the northern part of Tórshavn’s plantation. The gallery has a large selection of Faroese art. The oldest part of the museum, designed by J.P. Gregoriussen, was built in 1970, and in 1993, it was extended by the Danish architect Niels F. Truelsen in collaboration with J.P. Gregoriussen.

Since 1999, Steinprent has served as a meeting place for artists and art enthusiasts and consists partly of a workshop that produces lithography and partly of a gallery on the ground floor. The heads of Steinprent are the lithographer Jan Andersson and the graphic artist Fríða Matras Brekku. Per Kirkeby visited Steinprent on a working trip that inspired him to write The trip to the Faroe Islands, just as Ian McKeever, Julie Sass and Claus Carstensen have worked and exhibited at the gallery. The workshop has also collaborated with most of the established Faroese artists, for example the graphic artist Marius Olsen, who lives in Finland, but who regularly works and exhibits his precise prints at Steinprent.

Nordic world names, such as Finnish Terike Haapoja in 2014 and Icelandic Ragnar Kjartansson in 2019, are exhibited in the Nordic House. In Klaksvík, the local art association Norðoya Listafelag holds exhibitions and events, just as Gamla Seglhúsið is a very active gallery with changing exhibitions. In Vágur, a fine selection of Ruth Smith’s works can be experienced by appointment with the Ruth Smith Art Museum, and in Báta and Listasavnið in Leirvík, it is possible to see Jóannis Kristiansen’s paintings.

Crafts and design on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	The actress Sofie Gråbøl wearing the famous sweater from Guðrun & Guðrun during the filming for Danish TV series The Killing in 2012.

KELD NAVNTOFT/RITZAU SCANPIX Faroese handicraft and design have flourished throughout the 20th century. A closer look on how development and conditions have changed over the last 100 years reveals that an anonymised collective production, especially of woollen products, have become individual brands. Several local artisans and designers work professionally with their companies full-time and for some, it is an extra job alongside their day job.

Knitting as a craft has had favourable conditions to develop and become a well-preserved tradition. While most of Europe saw a decline in the mastery of, for example, hand knitting in step with industrialisation, this has not been the case in the Faroe Islands. This may be due to the isolated location of the islands and the fact that they have not managed to fully industrialise knitwear production. But the reason may also be that wool has been and continues to be an available material. Knitting also requires very small tools in the form of knitting needles, which are easy to transport and, not least, to import. Traditionally, the technique was mainly used to produce clothing, which is also the case today. Other materials, such as wood have been less available, as not many trees grow on the Faroe Islands.

Another technique is weaving, which, however, is more complex than knitting. It has been crucial for some of the significant artisans within the profession to pass on their expertise through private teaching and evening school classes. Among these are Olivina Joensen, Marjun Sigurdsdóttir, Tita Vinther and Súsan í Jákupsstovu. Poulina Jóanesardóttir has had her own weaving business in Tórshavn since 1990, where she, among other things, weaves fabric for Faroese national costumes.

There is a growing interest in making a living as an artisan and designer. The expertise that the culture has brought along is developing to an increasing degree, despite the fact that there are only a limited number of educational opportunities within the subject areas. However, some preparatory basic training programmes are offered at Glasir – Tórshavn College, where students can prepare for applying to, for example, design schools abroad. Føroya Fólkaháskúli also has a pottery and textile workshop. In the late 1970s, an attempt was made to establish a school of arts and crafts on Sandoy with Súsan í Jákupsstovu as the head; it existed for four years.

However, the tradition of handing down craftsmanship knowledge has meant that the Faroese products are of high quality both technically and in terms of form and expression. Generally, there is a preference for working with local products and with sustainability in mind.





Textile design


Vágsbotn at the head of Eystaravág is one of Tórshavn’s liveliest places with cafes, a fish and vegetable market and sale of various Faroese products, including homeknitted woollen products, such as jumpers and sweaters.

FINN FRANDSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2021 One of the first designers to make a name in the fashion industry was Barbara í Gongini. She graduated from the Danish Design School in 1996 and launched her own company in 2002. Her designs can be described as avant-garde and androgynous, and she often works in a monochrome black universe, in solid woven fabrics and in an asymmetrical silhouette. She is among the best-known Faroese designers and is represented in more than 35 countries. In addition to fashion, she also works on interdisciplinary projects with film, performance, art, sound and shows.

Guðrun & Guðrun consists of the duo Guðrun Ludvig and Guðrun Rógvadóttir. The company opened in 2006 with a small shop in Tórshavn. Since then, it has expanded to be represented in New York, Milan and Tokyo. From the beginning, it has been one of the core goals to be able to use the wool, which in the early 00s was mostly burned as there were fewer and fewer spinning mills. Another characteristic is that Guðrun & Guðrun’s collections always predominantly consist of hand-knitted products, which trace directly back to the Faroese craft tradition. Guðrun Ludvig, who is the designer of the duo, has managed to renew the traditional knitting patterns with her poetic and delicate touch. The best known is probably the hand-knitted sweater ‘Vón’ in two colours with a star pattern in horizontal lines on the body. It is made of 100 % Faroese wool and became internationally famous thanks to the Danish TV series The Killing. The ‘Sarah Lund jumper’, as it is also known as, has really shown the value of hand knitting both locally and abroad.

Ullvøruhúsið is one of the recently opened design shops in Tórshavn (2018), and the two designers behind it are Jóhanna av Steinum and Karen Sissal Kjartansdóttir. Jóhanna av Steinum graduated from Central Saint Martin in London in 2007 and launched the brand STEINUM in 2010. Her knitwear is characterised by brightly coloured patterns and is mainly made of wool fibres knitted by hand and on a machine. Karen Sissal Kjartansdóttir, who has a Master’s degree in economics and business administration and is a self-taught designer, launched the Shisa Brand in 2012 with a focus on sustainability and use of locally produced and processed wool. The Shisa Brand works with graphic contrasts in the wool, often in natural colours. This minimises the need for dyed yarn, which reduces the use of water and CO2.





Jewellery, interior and applied art


Steinprent by the port in Tórshavn consists of an internationally recognised graphic workshop and a gallery, which together form a powerhouse for contemporary art in the Faroe Islands.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 Østrøm is a craft and design shop located in the Skálatrøð port area in Tórshavn which opened in 2012. At the opening, six artisans and designers were involved, while today the number has increased to more than 30, including Elisa Heinesen, Rebekka á Fjallinum, Joel Cole, Durita Thomsen, RÓ, EINSTAKT and Klevang. From the beginning, Østrøm has been a catalyst for budding artists, who can present and sell their products in smaller collections fairly risk-free, as the artisans and designers pay a commission on their sales. Over the years, Østrøm has helped to establish several professional artisans and designers who, through exposure in the shop, have been able to take the leap and open their own shop.

Alia Gurli designs jewellery made of sheep horn with a simple geometric expression, which emphasises the material’s structure, colour and strength in the encounter with silver and gold. Her use of this demanding material is the result of a desire to breathe new life into the local resources which have been overlooked in recent times.

Since 2013, Turið Nolsøe Mohr has produced jewellery from basalt, gold and silver with a minimalist and geometric cut. She is a trained architect, but also chose to work with jewellery to get down to the details of the Faroese material and closer to the body.

In the field of interior design, mention should also be made of Osmund Olsen who graduated from the Kolding School of Design in 2013. In 2014, he launched his company under his own name and he mainly designs lamps from acrylic slats, which appear light, bright and modernist. He is one of the few in the Faroe Islands who works in this field.

Ragnhild Hjalmarsdóttir Højgaard, who graduated from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Design in Copenhagen in 2017, weaves and tufts rugs, sound panels and cushions from Faroese wool, which she keeps in its natural colour. Among other things, she has helped create interiors for restaurant NOMA in Copenhagen and the Hilton Garden Inn in the Faroe Islands.

The company Heimkaer also produces interiors, but in knitwear. Focus is on finely knitted merino wool in varying colours, where the structure appears three-dimensionally in the form of stones or patterned in traditional Nordic knitting patterns. Heimkaer was launched in 2013 by Ann Højgaard Slot, who graduated from the Kolding School of Design in 2012.

Since 1987, Guðrið Poulsen has had the ceramics workshop Leirlist in Tórshavn. She graduated from Myndlistaand handiðaskóli Íslands in Iceland in 1986 and produces unique functional designs, most often in the form of cups, bowls and plates. In recent years, she has also worked with decoration and smaller works of art made of ceramics.

Building style on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Archaeological investigations show that in the Landnam period, Viking Age longhouses were seen of the same type as are found in other Norse areas in the North Atlantic.

The good contacts with the centres and cultural currents of the time continued in the following more Europeanised period until around the year 1300.





Development of the residential building


Glass room in Tórshavn with the classic jamb stove and a corner cabinet. Through the doorway, a plate rack can be seen in the smoke room. Photo from 1898.

JOHANNES KLEIN/NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK In the time after about 1100, the longhouses became shorter than they had previously been, about 10‑14 m long, and the roof-bearing structures, which had previously been placed in pairs in the middle of the building, were now placed on foundation stones and moved to the sides. A good example of that building type can be seen in the excavation at Uppistovubeitið in Leirvík. The shorter longhouses with curved long walls are seen together with smaller rectangular buildings, which are separated by stone-paved tun or yards. Examples of this can be found in Inni á Tvørgarði in Miðvágur and in Yviri í Toftini in Sandavágur on Vágar. These buildings from the early High Middle Ages were in use throughout the 14th century, after which the more rectangular buildings became common. The long fire that characterised the Middle Ages now disappeared, and the hearth was placed in a corner of the living room.

Examples of log buildings erected using the dovetail method are seen on some large-scale farms. The best known preserved examples of dovetail log buildings can be found at the old episcopal residence in Kirkjubøur. One of the buildings at Junkarinsfløttur in Sandur was probably of this building type. The remains of the timber buildings excavated in Tjørnuvík are of the same type as known from medieval Oslo and Bergen, but the excavations in Innanfyri Heygagarði and in Eingjartoftum in Sandavágur, which date to the 13th century and later, are smaller buildings.

In the high medieval period of Europeanisation, stovan (farmhouse) replaced the Viking Age long house. The farmhouse was a stave building, but due to the lack of timber, the outer walls of the house were mostly made of turf and stone. The roof was made of turf on a base of birch bark. The space between the outer wall and the inner wall (bróst), which was made of wood, would accommodate sleeping alcoves, an entrance hall or rooms for storage such as the larder, called kovi.

The living room had an open hearth and a packed earth floor. The smoke drifted up through the louver, which, apart from the outer door, was the room’s only source of light. The stable was at one end of the house. The entrance was often shared by both people and livestock. If the house was on a hill, it could have a low basement used as a stable for the cows. Usually, the house would only have that one room, but some houses may have had a few more rooms.

The glass room came to the Faroe Islands in the 16th century following impulses from Western Norway, but it did not become common until around 1750. One of the reasons for this was the farmers’ good and stable income from wool production. It was made of timber as an extension of the smoke room and was provided with a ceiling, windows and usually a jamb stove. It had alcoves, tables and chairs. Some large farms sometimes also had a made-up bed, preferably a four-poster bed, with duvets in the glass room, which was the representative room of the house and a status symbol.

There have been a few log-timbered houses called stokkastovur in the Faroe Islands. Two have been preserved, namely the smoke room at the King’s yeoman’s farm in Kirkjubøur and the warehouse Stokkastovan on Tinganes in Tórshavn.

In addition to the residential house, there were outbuildings. The most important was the storehouse (hjallur), which was mainly used for food storage and therefore had to be airy: The wind had to be able to pass through the building. The simplest was opnahjallur with end walls but no sides. Others had end walls made of stone and long sides made of timber. Varðahjallur was made of timber on all four sides. Finally, there was the variant gróthús, which was made entirely of stone. This was usually away from the actual living quarters, sometimes on islets. On Norðoyggjar they had búarhjallur, one half of which was made of wood and the other of stone.

In most villages, there was a common sornhús for drying grain over an open fire. Boathouses (neyst) were located at the landing site. The roof of the outbuildings was made of turf on a base of straw, which was cheaper than birch bark.

Hay barns are a more recent phenomenon. As recently as the 1950s, hay was stored in haystacks in special hay yards (hoygarðar), surrounded by stones at a height that kept the sheep out.

For a long time, the closest thing to a middle class was the civil servants in Tórshavn and the vicars in the villages. The vicarages did not stand out significantly from the large farms, but that changed during the 19th century, when several new and more modern vicarages were built. These helped to change the building style. The common people in Tórshavn lived in small houses, often with basements. In these houses, the glass room, if any, was usually a little bigger than the smoke room.

Tórshavn was characterised by the Royal Monopoly buildings for various purposes, and merchant Niels Ryberg’s business in Tórshavn in the period 1767‑88 also left its mark. The fact that the Royal Monopoly established branches in Tvøroyri, Klaksvík and Vestmanna in the 1830s also had an architectural impact on these villages.

The introduction of free trade in 1856 and the growing fishing industry with an extensive production of dried cod did not only change the pristine coastal landscape with the construction of landing bridges, large paved or cobbled areas called fiskastykkir, where cod was dried, as well as warehouses, trade stalls etc. It also changed the appearance of the dwellings, because merchants, shipowners, skippers and ordinary fishermen now started to build houses of a new type, where the common bourgeois ideals of the time materialised in the interior of the house. This happened almost at the same time as the traditional farmhouse was influenced by the same ideals and thus entered its final phase of development. Many farms were mow extended with an additional living room, often including a small bedroom, a small ante-kitchen and an additional entrance called bakdyr, which became the fine entrance of the house intended for distinguished guests. Later, the smoke room was renovated into a more modern kitchen with a stove and window.





The cross-plan house


The cross-plan house, which now became the common house, was widespread in both Denmark and Norway. It was divided into four equal parts around the fireplace. On one long side, there were two living rooms and on the other the kitchen and entrance hall, usually with a small bedroom next to the entrance hall. The other bedrooms were in the attic. In the Faroe Islands, the house had a foundation of dressed stones, which was high enough to accommodate a cellar, and sometimes the end walls of the house could also be made of dressed stones.

There were some minor variations in the interior design in the oldest houses of this type, but within a relatively short time, the type was standardised and the interior design became identical. The smallest houses therefore had small rooms. Another reason for the new house type was that more builders had been hired who were trained in Denmark and Norway, and some had also worked in Iceland and travelled around. Many also went to Vallekilde Højskole (Vallekilde Folk High School), which taught them Nordic building style under the building crafts programme. The carpenters therefore had a major influence on recent Faroese building style: If they were told how big the house should be, they knew how to build it. The smallest houses had a basement, a ground floor and an attic with a pitched roof; the largest and most distinguished houses also had trimpil (one and a half floors) in the attic, which made it more spacious. Many also had a dormer. Houses with trimpil and dormer were often called skipper’s houses.

During the period until World War II, the cross-plan house became the prototype of a new Faroese home. The interior design was inspired by a bourgeois way of life, where both a living room and dining room were used. However, this way of life did not always harmonise with life in a Faroese village, so often the living room was just for show. On Vágar, several of these houses were fitted with a kind of mansard roof from the mid-1920s, probably inspired by Canada, where several men from Vágar found work in the 1920s.





The vernacular house type


A new cube-shaped, so-called vernacular house type with a stjørnutak (hip roof) saw the light of day after Word War II. The house could have one, two and sometimes three floors; the basement was usually not furnished, so unless the house had three floors, only one floor was intended for habitation. Houses with three floors had the layout of the cross-plan house, but with plenty of space for the bedrooms on the top floor. The appearance of the cube-shaped house varied from simple boxes without frills to beautiful functionalist houses with bay windows and balconies. Some were made of timber, but the most common building material after World War II was concrete. Inspiration has come from many places.

The foundation of the house was previously made of dressed basalt, but already from around World War I, foundations started to be cast in concrete, and gradually houses were built entirely of concrete. This was especially the case after World War II, but the interior design was the same, regardless of whether the house was built of timber or concrete.

For a long time, the roofs of both the traditional farmhouses and the new houses were turf on a base of nævur (birch bark). Some had slate roofs. Gradually, roofs made of zinc or corrugated iron, later also asbestos, became common. It also became common to clad the houses with corrugated iron, probably inspired by Iceland, which was visited by many Faroese fishing ships.

The building style was vernacular until recent times. Some carpenters, however, had their own ideas about the appearance and interior design of the home. They often brought these ideas with them from visits to Norway or Iceland, and you will therefore find houses, mostly in Tórshavn, in Swiss chalet style or with peculiar bay windows.





The standard house


It was not until around 1960 that new types of houses really came into their own. Actual standard houses of both foreign and Faroese manufacture now also became more common, as many people started to dream of having a detached house, preferably with a garden. The Faroese bank, Færøernes Sparekasse, arranged a competition for the exemplary detached house. The architect J.P. Gregoriussen won the competition in 1961. A few houses of this type were built as inspiration for future building projects. To a lesser extent, contractors have been in charge of the construction of large terraced housing developments. Town architect Gunnar Hoydal realised some successful urban plans, including ribbon developments, especially on the outskirts of Tórshavn. This area also had room for a fairly anarchic self-build approach, where the municipality accepted that in certain buildings in the fringe areas, initially there were no other requirements than a fire wall between the houses. Within the fire walls, everyone could create the house they wanted, which led to a relatively heterogeneous expression.

Since the year 2000, population has grown significantly and thus also the need for new housing. The quality of the housing construction is generally good, and the expression of the houses today is far more diverse than seen in the first half of the 20th century.





Other buildings


Draft of the north side of Christianskirkjan in Klaksvík by architect Peter Koch. The church was built in 1963.

ROYAL DANISH LIBRARY – DANISH NATIONAL ART LIBRARY, 2011 In the past, the church was usually the largest house in the village. Apart from a few stone churches, the churches we know from the 19th century were stave buildings with turf roofs which matched the other buildings. It was not until later that other architectural principles were applied in church construction.

After compulsory education was introduced in 1872, school buildings were erected in most villages. They were schools with one or two classrooms and sometimes an apartment in the school’s attic for the teacher. When the Brethren congregation and Home Mission came to the Faroe Islands around 1900, they built their own meeting houses, which fitted in well with the other buildings.

Eventually, the old schools became too small, and from the 1950, in some places before, larger primary schools were built with two or three floors, many of which look the same. In some cases, they were supplemented with more anonymous imported prefabricated schools. Production buildings, sports facilities, bank buildings and buildings for administrative functions and an airport terminal also started to characterise the building landscape.

At one point, the Faroe Islands were on the verge of demolishing several historic buildings. This was averted by arranging a competition for the future of the historic Tinganes in 1969. The old town in Tórshavn was threatened by the town’s largescale development and was falling into disrepair. The competition was won by Gunnar Hoydal, whose project meant that Tinganes today stands as one of the finest urban preservations in the Nordic region. Gunnar Hoydal later became Tórshavn’s town architect and he had great impact on urban development in Tórshavn.

Thanks to the development, which really kicked off 50 years ago, the Faroe Islands today have consultants spread over many different design studios.





Architects’ buildings


Private residence in Velbastaður with a view of the island of Hestur. The house was built in 2007 according to drawings by MAP Arkitektar, Tórshavn.

FINNAR JUSTINUSSEN/MAP ARKITEKTAR, 2018 At an early stage, the Danish civil service in the Faroe Islands used professional, usually Danish, architects and builders. The pompous chief administrative officer’s residence built in 1880‑81 from dressed Faroese basalt was designed by H.C. Amberg; the builder was Frederik Anton Bald, who was also active as a builder in Iceland. In the period around 1900, he constructed several civil servant’s houses and some merchant’s houses in Tórshavn.

With its building crafts programme, Vallekilde Højskole (Vallekilde Folk High School) in Denmark inspired many of the Faroese craftsmen who had studied at the school, and this is reflected in the architecture around the year 1900, both in residential houses and other buildings. Among these were Niclas J. Niclasen who is said to have designed the Faroe Islands’ first navigation school and Arnes Minde, which served as town council house in Tórshavn for many years. Hans Christoffer Andreassen, called Hans á Reyni, also built several residential houses and the village hall Tórshøll in Tórshavn. Magnus Jacobsen, called Magnus á Kamarinum, designed residential houses and several churches, including the church in Sandavágur.

But the best known was Hans Christoffer Wenningsted Tórgarð who was both a builder and an architect. He published a number of important works on Faroese building style in a historical perspective. He took a critical look at the new cross-plan house, the layout of which, in his opinion, did not fit very well with the requirements for a home in Faroese society. He gave examples of how, without major costs, it would be possible to develop the old Faroese building tradition and modernise it by using new building materials such as concrete, galvanised tile and sawn timber. The large residential houses include merchant Valdemar Lützen’s private residence and the country doctor’s official residence, both of which are located in Sigmundargøta in Tórshavn and are examples of well-proportioned wooden buildings with a stone foundation. Tórgarð also designed and constructed several large buildings. Among them are the Catholic school, St. Frans Skole, and the Catholic church in Tórshavn (1933); both are built of wood and adapt well to the size of the town. This also applies to one of his main works, the theatre building Sjónleikarhúsið (1926) in the heart of Tórshavn. Mention should also be made of the national hospital Dronning Alexandrines Hospital (1921‑23) and Færø Amts Bibliotek (the Faroe County Library) (1931). Tórgarð also designed a large number of churches, including the churches in Skúvoy (1937), Skála (1940), Hvannasund (1949) and Elduvík (1951).

Tórshavnar Musikskúli was designed by Kontrast as lead consultant and was completed in 2018. Astri Luihn has been in charge of the artistic decoration.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 After World War II, Olaf Mortensen broke with the earlier tradition; he represents a more closed architecture that is more brutal in both form and expression. His main works are Sjómansskúlin, the navigation school in Tórshavn (1962) and Føroya Studentaskúli (1965), the high school in Hoydalar. The two buildings are similar in appearance and do not relate to the softer identity previously seen in Faroese buildings. This can to some extent be seen in the many new school buildings erected from the 1950s onwards. Among these is Tórshavnar kommunuskúli (1954‑56), which has now been renovated and converted into the Finsen hall of residence.

In 1960, another architect emerged, Jákup Pauli Gregoriussen, from whose studio the next generation of Faroese architects was hatched. His first major task was, in collaboration with the designer Kristoffur Kristoffersen, to design Ebenezer, the Brethren congregation’s meeting house in the centre of Tórshavn (1963), a building that in many ways came to characterise the design studio’s work in the field of concrete construction. His designs also include the post office in Klaksvík (1967), the old-age and nursing home in Miðvágur (1967) and the primary school in Hvalba (1973). These buildings are more traditional and without much drama – focus is on proportions and on the roof forming a fifth facade. Later concrete buildings include the new National Library, Landsbókasavnið (1979), the Eysturskúlin primary school (1980) in eastern Tórshavn, the broadcasting house Útvarp Føroya (1982, extended in 1998 and 2016, respectively) and the technical college’s boarding house Skúlaheimið (1983) as well as the art museum Listskálin (1970/1989). All of these buildings are located in Tórshavn. These years, the design studio is looking into the possibilities of concrete, but in an expression that is far from previous Faroese building style. Later building projects include Føroya Sparikassi’s new building on Tinghúsvegur in Tórshavn (1985), a glass and stone building that adapts to the old urban environment and yet has its own expression. In his older years, Gregoriussen has gained a greater understanding of tradition, which he has also illustrated in his many book publications.

The period is otherwise characterised more by brutalism, postmodernism and other international movements than by a particular Faroese architectural development. It may therefore come as a surprise that especially buildings designed by foreign design studios are inspired by the Faroese environment. Among these can be mentioned a building erected by the Defence Construction Service, the building of radar station and NATO base in Mjørkadalur (1963), whose choice of materials is well-proportioned to the place and is based on Faroese tradition. These buildings have turf roofs, wooden cladding, an architectural breakup of the large volume and a new interpretation of the place. The same also applies to the two buildings Hotel Føroyar (1983), designed by the Danish architects Friis and Moltke, and the Nordic House (1982), designed by Norwegian Ola Steen in collaboration with Kolbrún Ragnarsdóttir from Iceland.

The Danish state has also been in charge of the construction of several buildings from the 1960s to the 1980s, including Christianskirkjan (Christian’s Church) i Klaksvík, designed by Peter Koch (1963). The Mental Hospital (1968) was designed by Carlo and Ole Odgaard. Føroya Læraraskúli/Venjingarskúlin (Faroese Teachers’ School/primary school) was designed by Stærmose’s design studio (1967). The Skúlin á Trøðni special school was designed by Erik Berg (1969). In Tórshavn, Holm & Grut are behind the Vesturkirkjan church (1974).

In the 1980s, Árni Winther’s design studio emerged from J.P. Gregoriussen’s design studio. So did the design studios Jórun í Dali & Høgni Larsen and Albert Isfeld & Gudmund Hansen, while Tróndur Fuglø opened his design studio (later called FUGLARK) in Klaksvík earlier. These design studios were behind most building projects for two decades. For example, Árni Winther designed the new Catholic church Mariukirkjan in Tórshavn (1987), Albert Isfeld & Gudmund Hansen designed the old-age and nursing home Lágargarður in Tórshavn (1988), and Høgni Larsen is behind the new Fríðrikskirkjan á Nesi on Eysturoy (1992).

When the economic crisis hit in the early 1990s, it also had major consequences for the architectural profession and the construction industry. Almost a decade passed before construction resumed and new design studios were established.

A representative of the latest architecture is the building erected for the bank Eik Banki (now Betri Banki) in Fuglafjørður in 2007, designed by Arkitektar 99. When the bank’s local branch was closed, the municipality bought the building, which is now the municipal office.

Bank Nordik’s round glass headquarters in Tórshavn (2015) was designed by MAP Arkitektar. At Húsareyn outside Tórshavn, there is also an inspiring battery park for wind turbines designed by Árni Winther (2017). Recent large building projects include the new high school in Tórshavn, Glasir from 2018, which is the result of a much debated architectural competition from 2010 won by the Danish architectural firm BIG – Bjarke Ingels Group. The glass building, which has become a landmark for the town, houses both the traditional upper secondary education, upper secondary business programmes and technical education in Tórshavn. In the same area is Føroya Musikskúli, designed by Kontrast (2018) and the town’s newest and largest primary school, Skúlin á Fløtum, designed by ZETA Arkitektar in collaboration with Brim Arkitektar and Árni Winther Arkitektar (2020). In Gøta, mention should be made of Ósbjørn Jacobsen-arkitektar’s town council house (2019) and the small football stadium Tórsvøllur in Tórshavn, designed by MAP Arkitektar (2021).

In recent years, several new building projects have been carried out in connection with increased tourism, and these include Hotel Hilton Garden Inn (2020), Hotel Brandan (2020), the extension of Hotel Føroyar (2020) and the new airport terminal. Moreover, a new hotel is being planned in Klaksvík.

Association activities and volunteering on the Faroe Islands

	 	Bylgjan, which is a combination of a sports hall and a cultural centre, is a handball arena from the 1980s that has been expanded into a sports and multi-arena in 2014. The handball arena was 1,100 m2 and was expanded with 2,400 m2. The arena was designed by BBP Arkitekter, and the project owners were Runavíkar Kommuna and Danish Foundation for Culture and Sports Facilities.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2021 The Faroe Islands have a large number of associations, most of which are engaged in sports, leisure and welfare work (social and health). Some date far back in history. The latter half of the 19th century saw the emergence of temperance societies and cultural associations, inspired by the public education movement and the nascent nationalism, as well as a few sports associations. In the following period, the membership numbers and importance of the temperance societies were changing, while other types of associations became more widespread. As society underwent a noticeable modernisation, and the population experienced greater prosperity and growth, a clearer division into work and leisure was also seen. This paved the way for changed cultural life and leisure time pursuits.

The changed cultural life resulted in many youth associations, which played a key role as gathering places in the local communities throughout the 20th century. In many villages, either temperance societies or youth associations took steps to build village halls which became the setting for entertainment of various kinds. More sports associations also saw the light of day, mainly in the large villages, where football in particular was popular among the youth.

Bylgjan, which is a combination of a sports hall and a cultural centre, is a handball arena from the 1980s that has been expanded into a sports and multi-arena in 2014. The handball arena was 1,100 m2 and was expanded with 2,400 m2. The arena was designed by BBP Arkitekter, and the project owners were Runavíkar Kommuna and Danish Foundation for Culture and Sports Facilities.

MARTIN SIRKOVSKY FOR THE DANISH FOUNDATION FOR CULTURE AND SPORTS FACILITIES, 2012 Today, the sports associations have the largest number of members among the voluntary associations. Most sports are practiced in local associations, which are largely affiliated to the national sports federation ÍSF (founded in 1939) and are organised in a number of special associations and clubs. The Faroe Islands have more than 120 sports associations with about 20,000 individual members. ÍSF is financed through fixed government grants. It is estimated that 2,000‑3,000 people are volunteering, corresponding to 40,000 working hours per year.

The first scout associations were formed in the early 1900s and have had changing membership numbers. The scout movement now has about 2,000 members divided into 30 local groups (The Baden Powell Scouts, The Salvation Army Scouts, YMCA and YWCA). Also, there is a nationwide union of children’s and youth associations (FUR). The 50 affiliated communities for children and young people have very different focuses, e.g. sports, scouting associations, political youth associations, temperance societies etc. Those interested can find communities in, for example, angling associations, ornithological associations and hiking clubs.

A large and important job is overseen by the around ten local rescue associations, which provide assistance in rescue operations in connection with missing persons or persons perished at sea and on land. These have a close collaboration with the official rescue service Vørn. Vørn manages a pool of funds which, upon application, can be allocated to local associations for special initiatives. In addition, the associations have a tradition of seeking assistance from people with particular knowledge of the area when it is required in connection with search work in the mountains or at sea.





Social services associations


Among the social services associations are the 24 patient societies which provide advice and support to people with various disabilities and chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, heart diseases, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease) with about 4,000 members. They are gathered under the organisation Megd, which fills the role of mouthpiece to the official authorities.

Since its establishment in 1926, Reyðikrossur (Red Cross) has had changing membership numbers and importance, but in recent years, it has gradually expanded its areas of work. These include visiting programmes, ambulance service, first aid courses and thrift shops as well as collections for international disaster relief. These activities are mainly carried out by voluntary labour.

There is a crisis centre for abused women with counselling and overnight accommodation. The work is largely carried out by about 35 volunteer women whose annual efforts correspond to more than 10,000 working hours. The number of inquiries from women in need has been increasing since its establishment in 1990. The crisis centre is managed by Kvindehusforeningen (the association of women’s houses) and receives financial support from municipalities and the Faroese Government.

Kris provides counselling and support to people who have been victims of sexual abuse, and Berin provides support to people in grief. Both associations have associated professionals, but also receive help from volunteers for practical tasks. The number of volunteers varies according to need.

There are a number of associations for retired and elderly people, 16 of which are affiliated to the interest organisation Landsfelag Pensionista.





Cultural associations


In the village of Vágur on Suðuroy, a local initiative has preserved several old boats. Among these is the smack Johanna TG 326, which is ready to sail and annually participates in regattas also outside the Faroe Islands.

EILEEN SANDÁ/CREATIVE COMMONS/WIKIMEDIA, 2016 A number of new associations established in the post-war period testify to an increasing interest in art and science as part of the strengthening of Faroese national consciousness. In the 1950s, academics joined together in a scientific society, and a writers’ association and several other more elitist associations saw the light of day. At the same time, focus was on formalising cooperation with foreign organisations (e.g. a branch of the NORDEN Association in 1951 and Amnesty International in 1964). Gradually, more associations came into existence to exert pressure on the political authorities in favour of new initiatives in the social and cultural field.

Practitioners from various schools of art have formed associations, 11 of which are affiliated to the umbrella organisation LISA.

Musical life includes many different forms, ranging from a symphony orchestra with 50‑60 active musicians, over 10‑12 brass bands with about 250 amateur musicians to the around 30 choirs with 400‑500 active amateur singers. There is also a jazz association and other large or small music associations.

Visual artists, actors and other artists are also organised in interest associations. Also worth mentioning are a number of local dancing clubs, whose aim is to maintain interest in traditional Faroese dance and which organise regular dance evenings or large events.

The interest in systematic collection and preservation of tangible cultural heritage can be traced back to the period around 1900. In 1916, the cultural history association Føroya Forngripasavn was founded to collect and disseminate objects. The association still exists, but its tasks have largely been taken over by the State in the form of Tjóðsavnið. Of a more recent date are the more than 20 local associations of cultural history that are more or less involved in the operation of the village museums, which have been established and are administered either by the municipality or as independent institutions, and which focus on the collection, preservation and dissemination of the local cultural heritage.

The largest art association, Listafelag Føroya, was formed in 1941 by Faroese people living in Denmark. In 1970, the association took the initiative to build the Listaskálin exhibition building in Tórshavn. It has about 400 members and is active with exhibitions and other art dissemination. Another art association, Norðoya Listafelag from 1985, has about 140 members. It is based in Klaksvík and purchases art and curates exhibitions.

In recent years, several environmental associations and organisations have been formed. These are independent communities, some of which are membership-based, and all work is done by volunteers.

Sports on the Faroe Islands

	 	For many years, the schools’ gymnasiums were the setting for the activities of the gymnastics clubs. This photo is from Havnar Fimleikarafelag in the late 1940s. There are three gymnasiums: Havnar Fimleikarafelag at Stórheyggi in Tórshavn (1974), Fimi in Gundadali in Tórshavn (2010) and Bylgjan in Runavík (2014). 3350F02444, TJÓÐSAVNIÐ From older Faroese literature and folk songs, it appears that sports and various forms of competition have always been an integral part of daily life. Rowing races in connection with hunting of pilot whales was well known. This also applies to various forms of more sports-oriented running competitions, throws and athletics.

In connection with ólavsøka on 28‑29 July, around 1780 sailing, rowing and swimming competitions were held. Around the same time, the employees of Niels Ryberg’s Trade in Tórshavn had built a riding ground outside the town, á Rundingi, as the place is still called.

The first local sports association in the Faroe Islands was Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag (TB), which was founded in the new fishing village of Tvøroyri in 1892. In the wake of urbanisation, sports clubs were founded in Tórshavn, Klaksvík, Vágur, the large villages on Vágar and later in Eiði, Gøtu and Leirvík on Eysturoy. Several of the clubs were football clubs, and the inspiration came with people who were from Denmark or had stayed there. The first was Poul Effersøe from Tvøroyri, who was known in the Danish sports club KB in Copenhagen, and among other pioneers was Jógvan Winther, who was the sheriff of Sandoy, the vicar on Vágar Carl Johansen, who had played football in the sports club Frem BK in Copenhagen, M.A. Winther in Tórshavn and Sniálvur Jacobsen in Klaksvík, who was a well-known football player in YMCA Copenhagen.

School teachers also took the initiative to teach the children how to swim. This led to the damming of several swimming pools in streams. The first concrete swimming pool was built in úti í Grøv in Klaksvík in 1906. Swimming pools were also established in remote villages, such as Mykines and Svínoy. Tórshavn had its first real swimming pool in 1930. The major breakthrough came in 1959, when Tórshavn got an outdoor swimming pool with warm water and a sauna.

Equestrian competitions have been held in connection with the festivities at ólavsøka since 1921, and the first Faroese Equestrian Championships took place in 1984 with time and gait competitions. The Association for Icelandic Horses became a member of FEIF in 1989 and participated for the first time in the world championships in 1993.

Since its foundation, HF, Havnar Fimleikarafelag of 1909 (Tórshavn Gymnastic Club), has organised popular internal competitions. The first athletics club was Bragdið from 1947. However, free sports did not boom until after 1989, when Oyggjaleikirnir, Island Games (sports events between islands), were held in the Faroe Islands, and the first athletics stadium was built in Toftir in that connection.

Until the infrastructure on the islands had been further developed, transport and logistics were the major challenges for sports competitions. The first nationwide championship tournaments under ÍSF auspices were in football and handball. Organised national football tournaments for men have existed since 1942 and for women since 1985. Neistin Tórshavn of 1931 was the first handball club, and national tournaments for women and men have been held since 1943. In addition to the capital, Vestmanna and Strendur were large handball villages from the very beginning.

In addition to TB and VB, which are also located on Suðuroy, it was in Tórshavn, Klaksvík and Vágar – Sandavágur, Miðvágur and Sørvágur that the greatest football activity was seen in the first years. The villages on Eysturoy, Fuglafjørður, Gøta and Leirvík, Runavík, Toftir and Eiði together with the villages of Sundalagið have since the 1970s, when the region was connected by good roads, distinguished themselves among the best, and in 1970 the football club B71 in Sandoy was founded.

Elite sports and Faroese Championships competitions are organised for children, youth and adults. Since 1988, there have been ten teams in the top football division for men. In women’s football, handball and other sports registration is more free.

It was a big step forward when the union Fótbóltssamband Føroya, FSF, set up a coaching course and when the football pitches were covered with artificial turf from 1986. After the international breakthrough and financial support from FIFA and UEFA, the conditions for national team football have improved, and for the biggest clubs, the elite of men’s football has become semi-professional.

For a long time, the disciplines that are considered indoor sports had no other place to train than in school gymnasiums or outdoors. It therefore made a big difference when new large sports halls were built, the first in Klaksvík in 1969. Volleyball was introduced by teachers from Denmark. The first Faroese Championships were held in 1969, and the first two clubs were made up of students at the Faroese Teachers’ School, Næmingafelag Føroya Læraraskúla, and high school students from Føroya Studentaskúli. Faroese Championships in badminton have been held since 1966 for men and since 1973 for women. HBF (Havnar Badmintonfelag), founded in 1959, is the oldest club, and the first international match was against Iceland in 1981. Faroese Championships in table tennis have been held since 1959. TBF (Tvøroyrar Borðtennisfelag) of 1948, is the oldest club, and the first international match was against Iceland in Tvøroyri in 1973. Faroese Championships in judo was first held in 1971. Havnar Judofelag of 1971 is the oldest club, and the Faroe Islands participated in the European Championships in Belgium in 1996 and the World Championships in Brazil in 2007.

Cycling and triathlon are organised in the same federation. Tórshavnar Súkklufelag from 1983 is the oldest club, and the first Faroese Championships in cycling were held in 1991. A triathlon club was founded in 2001, and the mountain bike club Fjallasúkklufelagið MTB in 2011. The first Faroese Championships were held in 2011. The oldest shooting association is Veiðufelagið Byrsumúli Tórshavn of 1980. The first Faroese Championships were held in 1983, and since 2009, the Faroese Championships have been held every year. The oldest archery club is Tambar Tórshavn from 1988. The first Faroese Championships were held in 1988, and the Faroe Islands took part in the World Championships for the first time in 2001.





Faroese sports in an international perspective


Tórsvøllur was completed as a national stadium when the Danish national football team visited on 4 September 2021 and won the WC qualifying match 1‑0 on a goal in the 85th minute. The match was sold out, and on the spectator rows, people had their own friendly match in the Unity of the Realm. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS In 1988, the Faroe Islands became a member of the international football union FIFA and in 1990 a member of the European football union UEFA. On September 12 1990, the Faroe Islands national football team played a tournament match under UEFA auspices for the first time. The Faroe Islands then participated for the first time in the European Championships qualifier in football. Due to a lack of internationally approved football pitches with natural turf, it was not possible to play the home matches in the Faroe Islands. Therefore, Landskrona in Sweden was appointed as the home ground in the first qualifying tournament. The first match was against Austria, which in the summer of 1990 had taken part in the World Championship playoff games in Italy. The Faroe Islands won 1‑0, Torkil Nielsen scored in the 62nd minute. This was breaking news and it was considered one of the most unexpected results in international football of all time.

Since 1992, when KÍ Klaksvík and B36 Tórshavn were involved in national champions’ and cup winners’ tournament, Faroese football clubs have participated in European tournaments. From 1992, the stadium at Svangaskarð in Toftir with natural turf was the home ground for all international football matches. From 1999, Tórsvøllur in Tórshavn was also the home ground for international matches. Tórsvøllur was completed as the national stadium in 2021.

The first internationally registered women’s national football match was played on 24th of September 1995, when Ireland won 2‑0 in the European Championship qualifier in Svangaskarð in Toftir. The first time a female club team participated in Europe was KÍ Klaksvík in 2001. Even before the great result in Landskrona in 1990, Faroese sports participated in international tournaments. In 1984, the Faroe Islands applied for full membership of the IOC, and in 2021 the Faroese home rule still worked to win IOC acceptance and membership. In 2019, the Faroe Islands gained the right to participate under their own flag in competitions organised by the European Olympic Committee.

Individually, some Faroese have participated in the Olympic Games under the Danish flag. Katrin Olsen took part in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in double sculls rowing for Denmark, and in 2021, Sverri S. Nielsen came fourth in single sculls for Denmark at the Olympics in Japan. Pál Joensen represented Denmark in swimming at the Olympics in London in 2012 and in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. In 2021, Jóhan á Plógv Hansen was on the Danish national handball team that won Olympic silver in Japan.

Parasport Føroyar gained membership of the International Paralympic Committee in 1981 and has participated in the Paralympic Games under the Faroese flag since 1984 in New York. In Seoul in 1988, Christina Næss won gold in the 100 m backstroke and silver in the 400 m freestyle, Katrin Johansen won silver in the 100 m freestyle and bronze in the 100 m backstroke, and Tóra við Keldu won silver in the 100 m freestyle and bronze in the 100 m butterfly and 400 m freestyle. In Barcelona in 1992, Tóra við Keldu won silver in the 100 m freestyle. In Sydney in the year 2000, Heidi Andreasen won silver in the 400 m, 50 m and 100 m freestyle and bronze in the 100 m backstroke, and in Athens in 2004 Heidi Andreasen won bronze in the 400 m freestyle.

Since 1970, the Faroe Islands have participated in the Olympic Games in chess. In 2016, Helgi Dam Ziska became the first Faroese Grandmaster. Since 2002, the Faroe Islands have participated in the European Championships in bridge.

In 1982 Jon Hestoy represented the Faroe Islands at the World Championships in swimming, and in 2008, Pál Joensen won gold for juniors in the 400 m, 800 m and 1,500 m freestyle in Belgrade. He also won bronze in the 1500 m at the World Championships in Istanbul in 2012, silver at the European Championships in Budapest in 2010 and silver in the 800 m and 1500 m freestyle in Berlin in 2014 as well as silver on the short track at the European Championships in Herning in 2013.

The Faroese national football team played its first international match during ólavsøka in 1930, where Iceland won 1‑0. In addition to Iceland, there were international matches against the Shetland and Orkney Islands from time to time. On 24th of August 1988, the Faroe Islands played the first internationally registered international football match. It was in Akranes in Iceland and Iceland won 1‑0.

The first national handball match for men was in 1964 at home ground against Iceland. The Faroe Islands gained provisional membership of the International Handball Federation in 1970 and full IHF membership in 1974. In 1972, the Kyndil Tórshavn handball club participated in the European Cup for men. In 1976 the Faroe Islands participated in the C World Championship tournament in Portugal, and in 1980, this tournament was held in the Faroe Islands. In 2018, both men and women participated for the first time in the World Championship and European Championship qualification tournaments in handball. In 2021, the Faroe Islands qualified for the first time to participate in the A group for U-18 and U-20 men.

Every other year since 1985 – with the exception of 2021, when the Covid- 19 pandemic prevented the Games from being held – the Faroe Islands have participated in Oyggjaleikir or the Island Games. The Isle of Man was the initiator and the overall aim was to create a forum where island groups had the opportunity to compete on an equal footing. In international tournaments, it is possible for individual islanders to be able to perform at the highest level. In team tournaments, this hardly ever the case. A committee consisting of members from the participating island communities decides where the Games will be held, and in 1989 the Games were held in the Faroe Islands. In 2009, the Faroe Islands won the Island Games; most medals were won in swimming and athletics.





Football pitches


Several football pitches have been established in magnificent natural surroundings. One of them is á Eiðinum í Vági on Suðuroy from 1929. The first was built at Sevmýri in Tvøroyri around 1900 and the next two in Gundadalur in Tórshavn (1911) and in Klaksvík (1910). MARTIN N. JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2018 Conflicting interests between agriculture and those interested in sports, as well as the hilly landscape, posed obstacles when football pitches had to be established, because the plots of land that were best suited for football pitches were also the best for agriculture in the early 1900s.

Before the first actual football pitches were established, football was played on sandy beaches, for example in the three large villages of Sandavágur, Miðvágur and Sørvágur and on Eysturoy in Gøtu, Fuglafjørður and Eiði, in Sandur on Sandoy and in Sumba on Suðuroy. In Leirvík, one of the initiators was a King’s yeoman, which is why it proved unproblematic to get permission to establish a football pitch in the outfield. Work began in the mid-1920s and the full-size pitch was completed in 1932‑1933. In Tórshavn, Hoydalar was the obvious option for football, but the surface was swampy and not dry enough, and after a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, they managed to get the farmer to hand over Gundadalur north of the town for the purpose.

In Fuglafjørður, the terrain made it impossible to establish a football pitch in Fløtugeður according to the formal regulations and dimensions in 1956, and it was not until 1979 that the pitch was expanded to the formally required size. The pitches á Mølini i Eiði in Vestmanna and Sumba are no longer used for ball games.





ÍSF and Poul Petersen


Today, the Faroese Confederation of Sports & Olympic Committee, Ítróttasamband Føroya (ÍSF), covers 142 sports clubs, which since 1980 have been organised into special unions and development unions. In 2014, it was decided that in future, the unions and not the clubs should be members of ÍSF.

ÍSF was founded on April 4th 1939 on the initiative of the school teacher Poul Petersen, whom the Swedish Parliament had hired in 1938 in a part-time position as a sports consultant. At the time, he was a teacher at Mykines, but he moved to Tórshavn when the position was upgraded to a full-time position in 1943. Poul Petersen was a sports consultant until 1954.

Before the ÍSF became a reality, two initiatives had been taken to organise the football clubs into a union: Færøernes Boldspil-Union 1913‑16 and Føroyska Bóltspæl-Sambandið 1930‑33. In 1942, the Løgting decided for the first time to earmark financial funds for the support of gymnasiums, swimming pools and football pitches, and in 1947 physical education became a compulsory subject in primary school. Inspirational courses were organised for physical education teachers, and pamphlets were published with material for teaching physical education and sports, e.g. ball games, swimming and gymnastics.

Poul Petersen was editor of the sports magazine Ítróttartíðindi, and he was the initiator of the Skúlaítróttarmerki Føroya sports medals. He also published a textbook on swimming, and intensive work was done to find suitable areas for athletics and swimming pools all over the country. As a result, football pitches were established in most large villages, first of gravel and later with artificial turf.

Both before and after the founding of the ÍSF, recurring events were held and great participation and excitement of the spectators were seen, even if it was only the victory in the one competition and not a championship that was at stake.





Rowing – A national sport


The annual highlight of rowing is the competition in Tórshavn in connection with ólavsøka, where the last of seven rowing competitions in June and July is held. In total, there are over 100 boats distributed across all boat sizes and age groups. OLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 Rowing in traditional rowing boats is considered the national sport of the Faroe Islands and has been a regular part of the sporting events at ólavsøka since 1924. Rowing races have also become a regular part of the annual summer meetings in the villages. The first, Jóansøkustevnan, is from 1925. Then came Norðoyastevnan in 1936, Vestanstevnan in 1945, Varmakedustevnan in 1951, Eystanstevnan in 1962 and Sundalagsstevnan in 1991. Rowing at these events is part of the Faroe Islands rowing championships, which have existed since 1964.

Rowing is divided into age groups and different boat sizes, as well as for women and men. Children and teenagers compete in 5-mannafør, girls and women in 5-mannafør and 6-mannafør, and boys and men in 5-mannafør, 6-mannafør, 8-mannafør and 10-mannafør. The grand final is at ólavsøka on July 28.

The bishop’s palace complex


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur In addition to the churches, the bishop’s palace complex was the most central building in Kirkjubøur in the Middle Ages. Part of the complex is now used as a museum of cultural history. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2008 Faroese-Danish-Norwegian archaeological excavations in the years 1953‑55 have helped provide an overview of the building history and layout of the bishop’s palace complex.

The foundations under the current buildings are thick masonry basement walls, which are remains of the medieval bishop’s palace. The palace has been an 2,500 m2 closed structure, which mainly consisted of two parallel wings located on either side of a 16 m wide stone-lined or paved courtyard. The east wing has probably formed a two-storey bishop’s residence built of stone. During the Middle Ages, this was rearranged in connection with the construction of the new cathedral. The rooms in the basement were oriented towards the courtyard. In the Middle Ages, the basement walls probably already supported a 45 m long and 7 m wide timber upper floor, which also included outbuildings. The courtyard was enclosed by stone walls to the south. At a later stage, a wing was added to the south in extension of the west wing down the west side of the cemetery.

Kirkjubøur’s old white-painted parish church from the Middle Ages is protected from the sea by walls. Above the parish church is the old King’s yeoman’s farm, which was built on the old episcopal residence. The ruins of the Magnus Cathedral can be seen on the far right. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 Like other church property, the buildings of the bishop’s palace, were taken over by the crown in connection with the Reformation and have since been a royal copyhold farm. Unlike other buildings in the Faroe Islands, the buildings are not stave structures, but dovetail log structures. The oldest part of the structure dates back to before 1350.

Havnar Kirkja (Tórshavn Cathedral)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Havnar Kirkja has been the cathedral of the Faroe Islands since 1990. Ordinations and bishops’ consecrations are usually held in this beautiful and colourful church, which is also a meeting point for special events such as ólavsøka.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 Havnar Kirkja (Tórshavn Cathedral) was built in 1788 north of the town as a replacement for Christian IV’s Church from 1609, which was located on Tinganes. It got its current form during a rebuild in 1865, when an extension on the south side was removed, a choir was built to the east, the tower was raised, large roundarched windows were inserted, the church was painted white and covered with slate. Further extensions to the east were made in 1935 and 1968. Inside, the gallery was extended so that it now extends from the western end, where the organ is located, and out to both the north and south sides.

The altarpiece, the Burial of Jesus, was painted by Ditlev Blunck in 1822‑24, and the church’s current interior colouring was done by Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen. Havnar Kirkja was made a cathedral when the Faroe Islands became an independent diocese in 1990. The unifying importance of the cathedral for the diocese and the country’s population is seen at the annual church service prior to the opening of the Løgting on the 29th of July. Since 2020, the church’s altar has on this occasion been adorned with the antependium Olavsøkuklæðið, designed by Edward Fuglø and produced at the Tapisserie Pinton tapestry in the town of Aubusson in France. The church carillon from 1952 is now automated and plays five times a day.

Churches on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Parish clerk service in Sands Kirkja 2nd Sunday in Advent 2021. Note the red ribbons that restrict access to the pews as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

JÁKUP REINERT HANSEN Remarkably little medieval church furniture has been preserved in the Faroe Islands. Some distinctive baptismal fonts have been brought to the museum in Tórshavn over the years, most of which are square or rectangular, and one is four-leaf clovershaped. They are made of soapstone and produced in Norway in the period 1100‑1250.

There are only three more or less well-preserved medieval church buildings, and all of them are located in Kirkjubøur. The parish church, the only medieval church still in use, was probably dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It dates from the 13th century and was probably built on the foundations of an even older church. Magnus Cathedral, the large High Gothic cathedral ruin, was built around the year 1300. And what is today referred to as Líkhús and has largely vanished into the sea, may be the church, Sankt Brandans Kirkja, which was presumably built in 1420.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church had a total of 61 churches in 2020. The old wooden churches on Nes and in Gøta have been replaced by Fríðrikskirkjan in Toftir and the new church at Gøtugjógv and are therefore only used on special occasions. The altarpieces in the Faroese Established Churches often feature art of surprisingly high quality. Apart from the church in Hósvík, the pulpit is always placed on the north side of the church. In Kirkjubøur, the hymn singing is without musical accompaniment. Some churches have harmoniums or electric organs, while the majority have invested in good pipe organs. A renewed liturgical interest is manifested in a large and varied amount of new chasubles and church textiles, mainly by Faroese artisans.

Havnar Kirkja (Tórshavn Cathedral) was built in 1788 north of the town as a replacement for Christian IV’s Church from 1609, which was located on Tinganes. It got its current form during a rebuild in 1865, when an extension on the south side was removed, a choir was built to the east, the tower was raised, large roundarched windows were inserted, the church was painted white and covered with slate.





Medieval church buildings


For a long time, it was believed that the Magnus Cathedral had never been completed and that the unfinished building fell into ruin. However, recent investigations indicate that the church construction was completed, that the church had a roof, doors and windows and was consecrated as a cathedral, and that it was in use until the Reformation and then fell into disrepair.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 The church buildings in the episcopal residence of Kirkjubøur stand in stark contrast to the more modest churches and prayer houses elsewhere in the Faroe Islands. The building style of the episcopal residence of Kirkjubøur was far more ambitious. It was inspired by the more pompous building style known from medieval churches, monasteries and castles outside the Faroe Islands. The buildings that were built of stone laid in mortar and with material-intensive timber structures, often dovetail log buildings, which were both expensive to build and required a great deal of craftsmanship.

The remains seen today at the episcopal residence of Kirkjubøur show a close connection to the Church of Rome and testify to the fact they were in a better financial position to build. Kirkjubøur became the islands’ ecclesiastical and cultural centre with contacts to the outside world, from where the ideology of the Catholic Church, foreign cultural currents and the power of the church were translated and exercised in Faroese society.

The current parish church in Kirkjubøur was built in the 13th century and is the only medieval church in the country that is still in use. Archaeological investigations under the church floor show that the church stands on the remains of older church buildings and burial sites. The rectangular building, whose external dimensions are 21.5 x 7.5 m, joins a number of Norwegian cloister churches from the same period, which are characterised by their length in relation to their width.

In addition to the churches, the bishop’s palace complex was the most central building in Kirkjubøur in the Middle Ages. Part of the complex is now used as a museum of cultural history.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2008 Kirkjubøur’s old white-painted parish church from the Middle Ages is protected from the sea by walls. Above the parish church is the old King’s yeoman’s farm, which was built on the old episcopal residence. The ruins of the Magnus Cathedral can be seen on the far right.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 The current parish church served as the country’s cathedral until the end of the 13th century, when the construction of a new, larger and far more richly ornamented cathedral in Gothic style started. It is today the ruin that goes by the name Magnus Cathedral.

About 100 m east of the Magnus Cathedral is a ruin of a smaller church building called Líkhús. Presumably this is the remains of a church, which in a written source from about 1420 is referred to as being under construction.

Faroese-Danish-Norwegian archaeological excavations in the years 1953‑55 have helped provide an overview of the building history and layout of the bishop’s palace complex. Like other church property, the buildings of the bishop’s palace, were taken over by the crown in connection with the Reformation and have since been a royal copyhold farm. Unlike other buildings in the Faroe Islands, the buildings are not stave structures, but dovetail log structures. The oldest part of the structure dates back to before 1350.





The old wooden churches


Sands Kirkja in Sandur was commissioned in 1839 and is a traditional wooden church. Archaeological excavations have found several other churches before this.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 What is today considered a typical Faroese village church is not, as in Denmark, a medieval stone church, but a 19th-century black-painted wooden church with white windows, turf on the roof and a tower in the form of a white-painted ridge turret. Apart from the altar, the entire church interior is made of scrubbed pine.

Of the eight old churches, the church in Sandur is of particular interest, as archaeological investigations have revealed that it is the sixth in a continuous series of churches in the same location. Supplemented with written sources, including the extensive church inspections of the 18th century, the church in Sandur reveals a building history that stretches from the small stave church of the 11th century over a series of increasingly large buildings with outer stone walls, which gradually acquires the simple rectangular shape: To the east is the choir, which is separated from the twice-as-long nave by a wooden wall with carved railings, and at the western end of the building is a porch with stairs to the gallery and bell tower. Technically, it was always a wooden structure, although the outer walls on the north and south sides were made of stone, and the roof was covered with straw or birch bark under the turf.

In the 19th century, the stone walls were replaced by exterior wooden cladding, which made the building lighter and brighter, as it could be fitted with more windows. The furniture is some of the finest craftsmanship created at that time.





The great building period 1850‑1950


Havnar Kirkja has been the cathedral of the Faroe Islands since 1990. Ordinations and bishops’ consecrations are usually held in this beautiful and colourful church, which is also a meeting point for special events such as ólavsøka.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 The growing population and continued problems with dampness and rot – many churches had to be renewed after 50 years of use – meant that in the second half of the 19th century, in addition to wood, churches began to be made of other materials, first boulders and then concrete. The churches at Viðareiði and in Húsavík are examples of a transitional type, where the inner stone walls, like the outer walls, are whitewashed, ceilings and pews are still made of unpainted pine, while the separation between choir and nave is considerably less significant. A later type has blue-painted, vaulted ceilings spangled with stars and painted furniture, pews and often also walls, often with wooden interior panels. Externally, this type of church still has white walls, while the joy of colour shows itself on windows, doors and roofs, where turf is replaced by slate or sheets of wood or aluminium, lead or copper. In many places, the east-west orientation is no longer seen, but the basic shape is still the simple rectangle. The period shows very little consideration for earlier Faroese church building in favour of style imitation, neoclassicism, art nouveau and the Bedre Byggeskik building style.

Among the many foreign and Faroese builders and architects, especially the Icelander Guðbrandur Sigurðsson from the second half of the 19th century and the Faroese architect H.C.W. Tórgarð from the first half of the 20th century should be mentioned. The latter has given the carved symbols from the choir walls and sacristies of the old wooden churches, such as cross, hourglass and tree of life, a new and decorative location.

The octagonal church in Haldórsvík, the shape of which is unusual for the Faroe Islands, was built in 1856 on the initiative of the vicar C.V. Prytz. In his own draft for the church, he wrote that the church ‘should be built in a layout hitherto unknown in the Faroe Islands’. The model was the baroque church in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen. Due to financial problems, however, it was not fully completed according to plan until 1932.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020





The present


The contemporary phase, which can be said to begin with Christianskirkjan (Christian’s Church) in Klaksvík, is distinguished by the size and architectural qualities of the churches – a union of functionality and sacred expression – and by a growing need for congregation rooms in addition to the church space itself. In a number of cases, this has been solved by fitting out the basement, which is often a necessary feature in the sloping terrain. However, most church buildings initiated since 2010 have also included actual high-quality parish community centres built in the immediate vicinity of the old churches and cemeteries and with respect for the historical environment. Several churches have been modernised and expanded, just as the construction of new churches is in the preparation phase.





Other places of religious service


Churches should also include buildings which, without being consecrated churches, are however designed for religious services or can be used as such. In the Middle Ages, the word bønhús (house of prayer) was used, and the word is still seen as the first part of a number of local place names. It is assumed that ongoing archaeological investigations will result in a more precise clarification of the purpose and use of these buildings.

Around 1880, when schools were built all over the country, the classroom of schools in a number of small and remote villages without a church was provided with the necessary furniture, allowing it to be used for regular perish clerk church service and, when the vicar visited, also for communion. Some schools even had a tower and a church bell. This use often led to a desire in the villages to have its own church, as is seen, for example, in Leirvík, Gjógv and Sandvík. A fine example of this dual function can be found in the abandoned village of Slættanes, where a teacher designed the school modelled after the church of his home village, Skálavík. In 1966, when the village of Ørðavík had a chapel which was used as a church with certain restrictions, the name Bønhús was used again. It is now used about a few mission houses and abandoned schools where services are held for the local population, without there being any talk of separating these villages as new parishes or establishing new parochial church councils.





Free church buildings


A simple and functional design is a common feature of the first free church buildings. In recent years, several modern free church buildings have been built, and a good example of modern church building is Keldan’s premises with space for about 1,000 people. The style is simple and functional, and light, sound and multimedia equipment has been installed. In most free churches, projectors are used to show announcements, songs, presentations for sermons, videos, etc. However, the architecture of the Adventist church and the Catholic Mariukirkjan, both in Tórshavn, is based on traditional church references.

The prefabricated church in Tvøroyri is located on a ridge and can be seen from most of the village. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 In 1990, the Faroe Islands became an independent diocese, and Havnar Kirkja in Tórshavn became the cathedral of the Faroe Islands. The photo shows a confirmation in the church in 2007, the same year that the Evangelical Lutheran Church passed to home rule. ÓLAVUR

FREDERIKSEN The church in Hvannasund was designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð and was commissioned in 1949. In 2016, the church house next door was inaugurated. It was designed by Mayfinn Norðoy. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS Glyvrar Kirkja consists of the old building from 1927 and on the left, the extension from 1981. Each year, the church forms the setting for several art exhibitions. Music always accompanies the opening of the exhibitions, and most times the artist also attends to talk about his works and the exhibition. The plan is to build a new church in the coming years. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 The eye-catching Vesturkirkja is one of the town’s landmarks. In the park outside the church is a statue of Sigmundur Brestisson, who, according to the Færeyingasaga, introduced Christianity to the Faroe Islands. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur About 100 m east of the Magnus Cathedral is a ruin of a smaller church building called Líkhús. Presumably this is the remains of a church, which in a written source from about 1420 is referred to as being under construction. The masonry is consistent with the information in the source and is supported by carbon 14 dating of skeletal parts found in the cemetery. According to the source, the church was to be dedicated to the Irish seafarer Saint Brendan. The width of the church is uncertain as most of the building has disappeared into the sea, but the building was 13 m long. Only the metre-thick north wall remains. The church stood in a cemetery that was surrounded by a dyke or fence of stone and earth.

The Magnus Cathedral


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur For a long time, it was believed that the Magnus Cathedral had never been completed and that the unfinished building fell into ruin. However, recent investigations indicate that the church construction was completed, that the church had a roof, doors and windows and was consecrated as a cathedral, and that it was in use until the Reformation and then fell into disrepair. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 The current parish church served as the country’s cathedral until the end of the 13th century, when the construction of a new, larger and far more richly ornamented cathedral in Gothic style started. It is today the ruin that goes by the name Magnus Cathedral.

The building measures 26.5 x 10.75 m. Characteristic of the church are the tall, slender and pointed arched window openings on the south side as well as the large window opening in the eastern end wall. In the easternmost part of the north wall is a 9.8 x 5.6 m side wing called Nunnukleystrið. It was presumably a chapel with a wide window opening to the east and a rose window to the west, and whose room was covered by a cross vault. In the floor below the east window, the foundations for an altar have been uncovered. The church originally had a tower in the west, from which there was an opening into the large church room through a 7 m high and 2 m wide arcade arch. The church was planned with six cross vaults, and it is uncertain whether these were in fact completed or whether another solution was found, such as a timber vault or a ceiling.

The Magnus Cathedral got its name from a reliquary tablet on the outside of the east side of the cathedral. The walled-in tablet of soapstone measures 65 x 63 cm and is decorated with a beautiful relief of Christ on the cross surrounded by Mary and Magdalene under three arches. Along the edge of the tablet is a Latin inscription, which states that it hides relics of Iceland’s saint-bishop Thorlacius and of the Orkneys’ saint, earl Magnus. The relics are kept in a lead box with a lid in the wall behind the tablet. Art historically, the tablet dates back to the first third of the 14th century.

The parish church in Kirkjubøur


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Kirkjubøur’s old white-painted parish church from the Middle Ages is protected from the sea by walls. Above the parish church is the old King’s yeoman’s farm, which was built on the old episcopal residence. The ruins of the Magnus Cathedral can be seen on the far right. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 The current parish church in Kirkjubøur was built in the 13th century and is the only medieval church in the country that is still in use. Archaeological investigations under the church floor show that the church stands on the remains of older church buildings and burial sites. The rectangular building, whose external dimensions are 21.5 x 7.5 m, joins a number of Norwegian cloister churches from the same period, which are characterised by their length in relation to their width. It is built of boulders laid in skilp, which is a local lime mortar, and it is plastered and whitewashed. In the eastern half of the church, there has been a panelled choir, which was separated from the nave in the middle of the choir wall. Around 1420, an extension, a memorial chapel, was added on the north side of the church, which was to be dedicated to Bishop Erlendur. He is the Faroe Islands’ best-known Catholic bishop and held office in the period 1269‑1308. In a written source from around 1420, the bishop’s residence had plans to elevate him to the saint of the Faroe Islands. During archaeological investigations in the years 1963‑67, a bishop’s grave dating back to the 13th century was found in the church.

The church’s exposed location on the coastal slope posed a danger that it could fall into the sea due to surf and other erosion. Therefore, in 1870, a retaining wall was built between the church and the sea to ensure the church’s existence after it had been condemned in 1864. The church was altered, renovated and given a new look in 1874. In this connection, its unique church furniture was brought to a museum – first the National Museum in Copenhagen, before being moved to Tjóðsavnið in the Faroe Islands in 2002. It consists of 16 pew ends (known as the Kirkjubøur chairs), two ends for a lectern or prie-dieu and a confessional. The furniture is made of pine and dates to the early 15th century. A figure that stood in the church, and which depicts the Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus on her lap, also brought to a museum. The 125 cm tall figure, which is believed to be a Western Norwegian work from the 13th century, is carved out of wood and was originally painted. When the church was restored in 1874, it was given a neo-Gothic appearance in the style of the time, both outside and inside. After the restoration in 1966‑67, it appears in a simple form, where efforts have been made to get as close to the medieval expression as possible. The altarpiece, Jesus vandrer på søen (Jesus walking on the lake), was made by the visual artist Sámal Joensen-Mikines.

Museums of cultural history and heritage on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	In 2002, the exhibition Úr útlegd (Home from exile) opened at the National Museum in Brekkutún 6, after the Kirkjubøur chairs and other objects had returned to the Faroe Islands by agreement between the Faroese and Danish authorities. The Kirkjubøur chairs include 16 chairs or pew ends, two ends for a lectern or prie-dieu and a confessional. They are believed to have been made in a West Norwegian workshop and are among the finest examples of church furniture and Nordic woodcarving art. The chairs were made for the Magnus Cathedral in Kirkjubøur, but were later placed in the old parish church. In connection with a restoration of the parish church, the Kirkjubøur chairs were sent to Copenhagen in 1875. THOMAS BILLE, 2021 The cultural heritage is looked after and managed by a number of cultural institutions, most of which were established by Løgting acts in the years after 1948, when the Faroe Islands were given home rule, and where archives, libraries and museums became special Faroese affairs. Some of the cultural institutions, however, date back to before the home rule arrangement.





Tjóðsavnið


The photo shows one of the Kirkjubøur chairs with Eric of Pomerania and Queen Philippa’s coat of arms as the motif. They were married in the period 1406‑30, and the chair therefore dates back to this period. Under the coat of arms, Mary and Elizabeth from The New Testament are seen. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS Tjóðsavnið (The National Museum) was established in 2018 by merging the country’s national museums of culture and natural history. The museum has departments of archaeology, ethnology, building culture, plants, terrestrial animals and marine animals. Its administration is located in Kúrdalur in Hoyvík on the outskirts of Tórshavn and includes an open-air museum. Nearby is the museum’s storage facilities and exhibition building at Brekkutún 6, whose permanent exhibition offers an experience of the natural and cultural history of the Faroe Islands. The natural history part includes the Faroe Islands’ geological origins, birds, fish, whales, benthic animals, terrestrial animals, plants and lichens.





Landsbókasavnið


Landsbókasavnið (National Library of the Faroe Islands) is located at J.C. Svabosgøta 16 on the fringe of the centre of Tórshavn. The building from 1980 was designed by J.P. Gregoriussen. It has its origins in Færø Amts Bibliotek (the Faroe County Library) from 1828 and is considered the Faroe Islands’ oldest cultural heritage institution. In 1931, the library moved into the newly built library building on Debesartrøð.





Tjóðskjalasavnið


Tjóðskjalasavnið (National Archives) is located near Landsbókasavnið, with offices in the old postmaster’s house and with a reading room and archives across the street. It has its origins in Færø Amts Arkiv (the Faroe County Archives), which was established in 1932, when the archives, togetherwith Færø Amts Bibliotek (the Faroe County Library) and the Historical Collection, moved into the library building on Debesartrøð. In 1952, Landsskjalasavnið (National Archives) was established by a Løgting Act. In 2018, Landsskjalasavnið changed its name to Tjóðskjalasavnið, and at the same time the archives act was amended to also include digital records.

The National Library was established by a Løgting Act in 1952 and is both a national and central library and has an audiobook service for people with visual and reading disabilities, just as it is in charge of paying public lending right fees. It has an extensive collection of manuscripts from Faroese authors and also has a collection of older manuscripts, including an edition of Sandoyarbók, on permanent loan from the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen, with some of the oldest copies of the Faroese ballads about Charlemagne.

Landsbókasavnið is a research library, and with the planning of a new campus for Fróðskaparsetur Føroya (University of the Faroe Islands), the current intentions are for it to also become a university library. Most towns and large villages have public libraries or combined public and school libraries.

Gøtu Fornminnisfelag (Museum Association)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Blásastova in Norðragøta is one of the many old houses around the country that have been converted into a local native museum. These museums and the surrounding buildings have been preserved as a significant cultural heritage at the initiative of the Gøtu Fornminnisfelag.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 In 1969, Arnleyg Jacobsen and her husband, Tummas Jacobsen, took the initiative to found the museum association Gøtu Fornminnisfelag. The restoration of the nearly 200-year-old Blásastova farmhouse had already begun in Norðragøta. In 1971, the farm was ready for a royal visit, and it has since served as a museum with a great wealth of historical objects.

Later in the 1970s, the association bought and restored the neighbouring building Glyvrahanusarhús, which was an old fisherman’s dwelling. It is used both as a museum and as the association’s common room.

Around the square formed by the two houses, there were two other buildings from the 19th century, Jákupsstova and Hjá Peri, which the owners also restored. Together with the old church from 1833, these buildings form an entire neighbourhood, which today constitutes a unique museum environment from the mid-19th century. In the basement of Jákupsstova, some old walls called Tróndargrund can be seen. They are said to be the last remains of Tróndur í Gøtu’s house.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS The cultural history part includes an archaeological exhibition about the Viking Age and the Middle Ages, historical events and objects, the development of fishing and whaling as well as the Faroese rowing boat and national costume. The cultural history part of the museum has its origins in the Føroya Forngripagoymsla (Faroe Islands Historical Collection) from 1898, when the collection of objects from all over the country was initiated. The establishment of the historical collection was a counterweight to the collection that The Royal Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities had started in the Faroe Islands in 1817, and which continued throughout the century. The collected objects were sent to the Royal Museum of Nordic Antiquities, the Danish Folk Museum and later to the National Museum in Copenhagen. In 1931, the historical collection was transferred to the newly built library building on Debesartrøð in the centre of Tórshavn, where it shared premises with Færø Amts Bibliotek (the Faroe Library) and Færø Amts Arkiv (the Faroe County Archives). Føroya Fornminnissavn (Faroe Islands Museum of Cultural History) was established as a public institution by a Løgting Act in 1952. Føroya Forngripagoymsla became part of the museum and was tasked with safeguarding the country’s cultural heritage through administration of the Ancient Monuments Act from 1948. In addition to the museum’s exhibition in the library building on Debesartrøð, the museum got more spacious premises in Bátahøllin (the boat hall) in 1952, which had room for both the museum of cultural history and the new museum of natural history. In 1996, the museum of cultural history moved its exhibition to the current premises in Brekkutún.

The natural history part has its origins in older geological, zoological and botanical collections, including the botanical collection Herbarium Faeroensis. Jarðfrøðisavnið (Museum of Geology) was established by a Løgting Act in 1951. By an amendment to the act in 1955, the museum was expanded to also include zoology and botany and was given the name Føroya Náttúrugripasavn (Faroe Islands Natural History Museum). Later, Jarðfrøðisavnið became part of Jarðfeingi (Faroese Geological Survey), and Biofar, Havlívfrøðiliga Royndarstøðin (Marine Biological Research Centre), became part of the museum. In 2012, the exhibition of the natural history collections moved to the premises in Brekkutún.

Tjóðsavnið is a cultural heritage authority and handles tasks involving preservation and dissemination of ancient monuments and buildings. Among the protected ancient monuments and buildings are Havnar Skansi (Redoubt of Tórshavn), Kirkjubømúrurin (the cathedral ruin in Kirkjubøur) and other historical monuments in Kirkjubøur, buildings and cultural landscape on the island of Koltur, the King’s yeoman’s farm Dúvugarðar in Saksun, the vicarage in Sandagerði in Tórshavn, the residential houses í Koytu in Sandur and Húsið uttan Ánna in Sandvík and the farm in Depli. The largest complexes of listed buildings are the Royal Monopoly in Klaksvík, Tvøroyri and on Tinganes in Tórshavn. Of the country’s 61 churches, 17 are listed and most are distinctive wooden churches from the 19th century. In 2009, ancient monuments from World War II were covered by the Ancient Monuments Act. The whaling station við Áir is preserved and disseminated as an example of industrial cultural heritage from the early 1900s.

The museum manages support schemes for local museums and ships worthy of preservation. Some local museums also have local archives. 25 local museums of cultural history, an aquarium and three art museums receive financial support. Most operate on a voluntary basis and are independent institutions, while a few are municipal museums. The support scheme for ships helps to preserve and keep the historic ships sailing.

The Faroe Islands have adopted several of UNESCO’s conventions in the field of culture, most recently UNESCO’s Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage from 2003, adopted by the Løgting (the national parliament) in 2018. In 2021, as part of the Nordic clinker boat traditions, the Faroese boat was included in UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Tjóðsavnið has been given responsibility for managing the convention.

Literature on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	In the period 1967‑2020, Faroese book publishing was characterised by large fluctuations in an overall strongly growing trend. It is very clear that the publication of children’s books took off in the mid-1980s and that the number of works of fiction was low during the crisis years of the early 1990s and then almost reached the level of children’s books. Textbook publications are relatively constant, while non-fiction has increased considerably during the period. HAGSTOVA FØROYA The first book with Faroese text was published in 1822. In this book and the following seven, which were published until 1892, there were explanatory texts in Danish. The first book written exclusively in Faroese was published in 1892. Since then, modern Faroese literature has grown, and now around 200 books are published annually, of which about half is fiction and children’s literature, and the other half is non-fiction and textbooks.





19th-century folk songs and national romanticism


Jens Christian Oliver Djurhuus wrote his poems in Faroese. These are new ballads, i.e. long, narrative poems in folk song style with the main emphasis on Faroese history as told in Snorri Sturluson’s Heimskringla. The son, Jens Hendrik Djurhuus, followed in his father’s footsteps, but found his sources with Saxo. These poems were used in the chain dance, as were the orally handed down and anonymous ballads. Through collection, they were written down, and they made up the majority of 19th-century Faroese fiction. In the late 1840s, the tradition of writing Faroese based on pronunciation was replaced by the Hammershaimb orthography. The same Hammershaimb also collected and published folk songs.

In the late 1800s, the national movement boosted the use of the Faroese written language and spawned a large number of national romantic songs, tales and plays. With a single precursor in 1850, Faroese contemporary poetry began in 1876, when Faroese students at the residential college Regensen in Copenhagen met for a Shrovetide party and sang patriotic songs. These songs were released as Føriskar vysur (Faroese songs) with titles, lyrics and comments in Faroese. They were in the philologist Jakob Jakobsen’s new alternative written form, which, however, never caught on. At the turn of the century, the national romantic tone sharpened towards the political in poems by Jóannes Patursson and the religiously high-flown in e.g. the poem by Símun av Skarði, which later became the national anthem of the Faroe Islands, Tú alfagra land mítt from 1906. The poems, songs and other texts published in the late 1800s defined and located the Faroe Islands as a country with its own independent culture.





1900s


The first novel in Faroese, Bábelstornið (The Tower of Babel) from 1909, is a naturalistic family novel describing the arrival of national ideas in the mid-19th century and the break between traditional thought patterns and new currents. The novel’s author, the folk high school founder Rasmus Rasmussen, wrote under the pseudonym Regin í Líð and also published the first Faroese collection of short stories in 1912. In 1914, Jens Hendrik Oliver Djurhuus published the first modern collection of poems, Yrkingar, which is influenced by symbolism and where the national appears in grandiose metaphors in contrast to sharp criticism. With his poems, songs, nursery rhymes and fairy tales, the brother, Hans Andrias Djurhuus, became known and loved by everyone and still is.





Realism


The author and visual artist William Heinesen achieved international fame and was a key figure in Faroese cultural life in the mid-20th century. PER PEJSTRUP/RITZAU SCANPIX, 1970 The political polarisation between Danish unity and independence made it progressive to compose and write in Faroese. The internationally bestknown author, William Heinesen, wrote in Danish, which was interpreted as a loss for Faroese. In 1935, the linguist and poet Christian Matras published the first Faroese literary history, in which he omitted William Heinesen, who at that time had published four poetry collections and his first novel, Blæsende Gry (1934, Stormy Dawn). Heinesen’s breakthrough novel was the satirical description of the war The Black Cauldron (1949), which was followed by the imaginative tale from Tórshavn The Lost Musicians (1950). In 1965, he received the Nordic Council Literature Prize for The Good Hope (1964). Heinesen’s writing includes seven poetry collections, seven novels and seven short story collections, but he was not widely read in the Faroe Islands until a number of his works were translated into Faroese on the occasion of his 75th birthday. These translations were part of the movement that strove to make Faroese literature monolingual.

At the same time as William Heinesen wrote his first realistic novels with a socialist edge in the 1930s, Hans Jacob Jacobsen first appeared under the pseudonym Heðin Brú with the development novel consisting of the two volumes Lognbrá (1930, Deception of Sight) and Fastatøkur (1935, Firm Grip), which depict a peasant boy’s break with the old village society. Brú’s main work, Feðgar á Ferð (The Old Man and His Sons) from 1940 (in Danish: Fattigmandsære, 1963), contrasts the traditional and the modern Faroese mentality in humorously grotesque contrasts between the generation of parents, who live in a subsistence economy, and their adult children, who live on money wages. Brú’s short stories are stylistically reliable classics, and in the mid-1900s, they had great significance for the development of Faroese prose.

The transition to a fishing and money society is complete in Martin Joensen’s novel Fiskimenn (Fishermen) from 1946, which, like Fastatøkur, realistically depicts life on board the fishing ships of that time. Martin Joensen’s contribution to the genre is the contrast between shipowners and fishermen and between workers on land and fishermen, which results in strikes and industrial action. The same themes can be found in Joensen’s second novel, Tað lýsir á landi (Dawning on land) from 1952.

The author Jóanes Nielsen in his office in Tórshavn, where he lives close to the water. LARS JUST/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2012 Around 1950, Faroese literature had become monolingual in the sense that the new authors wrote in Faroese. They had been taught Faroese from the first day of school, when it had become a full-fledged school subject in 1938, and the language of instruction thereafter was Faroese. Jens Pauli Heinesen belonged to this new generation and published his first short story collection Degningsælið (Morning Dew) in 1953, which was followed up by a series of novels about artists’ problems, right-wing forces in society and the seven-volume memoir Á ferð inn í eina óendaliga søgu (1980‑92, A Journey Into an Unending Story).

Realism found a new socially engaged form with Jóanes Nielsen. He is one of the great living authors who writes both novels and poems, and was first published in 1978. He was an active participant in the 1970s leftwing political movements and has published ten collections of poems, the first with clear socialist views interspersed with personal reminiscences. These have since gained more space and have been combined with ecocritical themes. His novels depict labour struggles and social conditions in today’s Tórshavn. Glansbílætasamlararnir (2005, The Scrapbook Collectors, in Danish: Glansbilledsamlerne, 2008) is a memoir about the fates of young men in 1950‑70s Tórshavn and Copenhagen and a vivid depiction of the challenges of masculinity in late modern Faroese society.





Modernism


Christian Matras wrote poems about the Faroese landscape since his debut Grátt, kátt og hátt: yrkingar from 1926. But he definitively moved poetry out of national romanticism towards modernist formal features and existential themes, which were also seen with Regin Dahl and became more prominent with Karsten Hoydal. Karsten Hoydal made his first appearance as a writer with the collection Myrkrið reyða (The Red Darkness) in 1946 which was influenced by the horrors of World War II and demands for reorientation. Fully modernist is Guðrið Helmsdal’s poetry collection lýtt lot (mild breeze) from 1963, which is made up of original image-creating poems. Steinbjørn B. Jacobsen made his debut with Heimkoma (Homecoming) in 1966, and his later poetry collections indulge in the ultra-short, sometimes concrete modernism. Rói Patursson successfully entered the scene in 1969 with an untitled collection of poems, and in Líkasum from 1985, for which he won the Nordic Council’s Literature Prize the following year, he combines a modernist form with the political and cultural views of his time. Heðin M. Klein, who in his own low-key way participated in the modernist upheaval of the 1960s, examines the possibilities and limitations of poetry in depictions of life’s small and large challenges with the long poem Tað orðið (2020).





Postmodernism and ecopoetry


Postmodernism and deconstruction characterise poetry and novels in the last decades of the 20th century. Here, the familiar meanings of the language are dissolved to be filled with new ones. During the 1980s, the modernist breakthrough of the 1960s was replaced by the act of writing, intertextuality and self-reflexitivity, in the lyrics; an orientation that Tóroddur Poulsen and Carl Jóhan Jensen in particular are exponents of. Tóroddur Poulsen’s poems have a distinctive subtle tone, where the words are twisted in and out of context and constantly change meaning; Carl Jóhan Jensen’s poems challenge the reader with ambiguous references to other texts or the etymology of words. After a few years mainly as a lyricist, he threw himself into prose and published large novels, including the grotesquely burlesque Ó -, søgur um djevulskap (2005), which depicts events in the Faroe Islands over several hundred years and is filled with notes that make the reader more curious rather than more enlightened.

Alongside the systemic approach in the poetry, a social psychological realism has been developing in short stories by Hanus Kamban, Oddvør Johansen and Gunnar Hoydal. Unlike the realism of Heðin Brú and Martin Joensen, this one is more individualoriented. Oddvør Johansen’s first novel Lívsin summar (The Summer of Life) was published in 1982 (in Danish: Livets sommer, 1985), and with her light prose, she immediately gained many readers. In short stories, novels and essays, she has since maintained her position as one of the most widely read Faroese prose writers. Hanus Kamban’s short stories often have a retrospective perspective, unfolding the past from a contemporary situation; in addition to his own prose, he has translated foreign fiction into Faroese and published monographs on other authors. Gunnar Hoydal quickly moved from the short stories to the novel genre. A recurring motif in his writing is the journey and the relationship between the small country in the North Atlantic and the wider world. The novel Í havsins hjarta (In the Heart of the Sea) from 2010 (in Danish: I havets hjerte, 2010) is a grandiose attempt to write the history of the national movement of the Faroe Islands as a family history, beginning with the arrival of the Danish vicar Jørgen Falk Rønne to the islands in 1889. The departure, the arrival and the stay in the foreign land are found as motifs in many short stories and novels from the second half of the 20th century, including in Bergtóra Hanusardóttir’s novel Burtur (2006), which depicts her study years in Copenhagen.

Oddfríður Marni Rasmussen has taken modernism in a more personal direction with poems about his own upbringing, friends and parents. With the novel Ikki fyrr enn tá (Not Until Then) from 2019 (in Danish: Først når, 2020) about a man’s reactions to his wife’s battle against a terminal illness, he reached a large readership with straightforward and vivid prose. The personal writing characterises Katrin Ottarsdóttir to an even greater extent. Her debut poetry collection Eru koparrør í himmiríki? (Are there copper pipes in heaven?) (in Danish: Findes der kobberrør i himlen? 2016), was published in 2012 and portrays a deranged mother and a self-destructive father from a child’s perspective.





Hybrid forms


An increased reflection on the national, language and nature was already found in the poetry of the 1980s, sometimes as irony and pastiche. But a new and more serious rethinking of the relationships between people, nature and language can be found in current Faroese poetry, which also seeks a more complex expression in form.

In particular Kim Simonsen has dealt with nature and ecocriticism in his poetry, which in terms of content is closely connected to his work as a literary researcher; and he likes to quote directly from scientific literature in his poems.

Trygvi Danielsen’s debut in 2013 with The Absent Silver King, consists of poems, short prose and a CD, and English appears both in the title and in several texts. The publication is a break with the monolingual ideal and with the traditional view of the poetry collections as a work.

The expansion of the lyric towards the more complex in terms of genre and form became particularly evident with Lív Maria Róadóttir Jæger’s stylistically successful publication Hvít sól in 2015, consisting of short poetic texts about human relationships, cognition and language. She further developed this form in Eg skrivi á vátt pappir (I Write on Wet Paper) from 2020 (in Danish: Jeg skriver på vådt papir, 2021). Anna Malan Jógvansdóttir has written poems about man’s place in the cycle of nature and in 2019 published the form-experimental Psykosudrotningin with the subtitle Hybrida.

With twenty novels, Jógvan Isaksen has had almost an exclusive right to define the popular crime genre. He subscribes to the socially conscious and debating Nordic crime fiction. At the same time, a strong awareness of tradition is expressed, as many of the book titles refer to folk songs, and the novels frequently refer to recent Faroese poetry.





Barbara


Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen’s novel Barbara and its afterlife exemplarily illustrates Faroese literary history in concentrated form. It was published posthumously in 1939 and is based on a story about a woman and her marriages to three vicars. The legend takes place in the 17th century, while the novel is set in the 18th century. The novel is written in Danish and thus belongs to the bilingual period in Faroese literature; a Faroese translation was not published until 1972.

Barbara, however, was soon translated into a number of other languages, and it has been the subject of biographical and historical analyses, just as feminist and postcolonial studies have focused on the novel’s literary devices and multifaceted universe. Last but not least, the novel has been made into a film several times, most recently by Nils Malmros in 1997, which has further contributed to its spread.

On the right is a picture from the Danish director Nils Malmros’ film adaptation of the novel. The Norwegian actor Anneke von der Lippe played the role of the Faroese vicar’s wife and Danish Lars Simonsen played her husband, the young Mr. Poul from Denmark. The film premiered in Copenhagen on 2 October 1997 and was well received by the critics.

Children’s literature in Faroese


At the beginning of the 20th century, called the children’s century, literature in Faroese for children came on the agenda with the first children’s and youth magazine, Ungu Føroyar (The Young Faroes), in 1907. It ran stories and poems with an educational content.

Teachers have been the driving forces in terms of writing and publishing children’s literature. The popular author Hans Andrias Djurhuus wrote the first poetry collection for children, Barnarímur (1915), which not only taught children, but also their parents and other adults, to read poetry. Since the 1950s, translated children’s books have made up a significant proportion of publications.

The great leap forward for children’s literature in Faroese occurred in 1986, when the teachers’ association established a children’s book club with the aim of making it possible to acquire cheap books throughout the country. The book club publishes eight books a year, mostly translated and produced in international co-production, which has considerably increased the range of books for children of all age groups.

The children’s and youth literature is published by BFL (Bókadeild Føroya Lærarafelags – the Faroese Teachers’ Association’s Publishing Company) and the publisher Sprotin, and most of the publications are translations. The authors Bárður Oskarsson and Rakel Helmsdal have been translated into many languages and have won both domestic and international awards; Bárður Oskarsson for his minimalist picture books and Rakel Helmsdal for her imaginative stories.

Media on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	A look into the control room of KVF. The television news ‘Dagur og vika’ is broadcast four times a week. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2022 At the end of 2020, the written media market consisted of four newspapers: Dimmalætting, Norðlýsið, Sosialurin and Oyggjatíðindi as well as a number of internet news portals. Some are linked to the newspapers, while others are staffed by a single or a small handful of employees. Newspapers and portals are financed via advertisements, private enterprises and media support.

Historically, the Faroe Islands have had 27 different newspapers, and newspaper history can be divided into five periods: Føringatíðindi was published nine times in 1852 and marked the beginning of the first period (1852‑1890). It was not until 1877 that the next newspaper, Dimmalætting, was published. Then came the period known as the golden age (1890‑1946). Towards the turn of the century, several newspapers appeared. The first local newspaper, Norðlýsið, was founded in 1915. The publication of Føroya Sosial Demokrat (later Sosialurin) started in 1927, and Dagblaðið, which later became the mouthpiece of the Faroese People’s Party, subscribed to centre-right wing in 1935. Most newspapers were only published for a few years, and the newspaper debate was characterised by national revival and industrialisation. The third period (1946‑1990) was characterised by the flourishing of the party press. The Cold War created a sounding board for debate, and party political journalism intensified. The four major parties each had their own newspaper; in addition to Sosialurin (Javnaðarflokkurin), Dagblaðið (Fólkaflokkurin) and Dimmalætting (Sambandsflokkurin), the newspaper 14. september was published in 1947 and became the mouthpiece of Tjóðveldi.

The emergence of the radio Útvarp Føroya in 1957 reduced the importance of newspapers as news agencies. The composition of the party press remained fairly stable until the 1990s. The beginning of the fourth period (1990‑2008) was characterised by crisis. About 13 % of the population emigrated, newspaper sales fell drastically and several newspapers closed. The fall of communism and the rise of internet media represented changes in the context and publishing opportunities, and the newspapers’ became less associated with the political parties. Sosialurin launched Internet Sosialurin in 1998, and several small news portals followed suit.

The fifth period (2008 to now) is faced with the same drastic changes in the media landscape as in other countries. The newspapers compensated for the decline in newspaper sales after the financial crisis by introducing online subscriptions, which were not as profitable. Advertising revenue was further challenged by the US tech giants, which provided a platform for cheaper advertising. After bankruptcy, Dimmalætting was relaunched as a weekly newspaper in 2014.

The private media’s resources never rose to the same level as before the financial crisis. In 2016, the government decided to support these media in the form of an annual subsidy of DKK 2 million.





Útvarp Føroya – Radio of the Faroe Islands


In 1957, following a decision by the Løgting, the public Faroese radio, Útvarp Føroya (ÚF), began to broadcast news, weather forecast and talk and music broadcasts for an hour and a half every day. In the 1960s, the range of programmes was expanded with live broadcasts and radio dramas. Revenue came from licence fees and advertising. In 1969, the V4 Lottery gave ÚF the opportunity to start the necessary modernisation, and in 1982, ÚF moved into a new broadcasting house. Broadcast time was gradually extended to 24 hours towards the turn of the millennium.

From the beginning, ÚF was characterised by a public service mindset, which meant that the radio contributed significantly to social cohesion. In 2005, ÚF merged with the public television channel, Sjónvarp Føroya (SVF), resulting in Kringvarp Føroya (KVF).





Sjónvarp Føroya – Television of the Faroe Islands


Following a decision by the Løgting, public television, Sjónvarp Føroya, started broadcasting in 1984. Revenue came from licence fees and advertising, but the population base meant that resources were scarce. In addition to a weekly news broadcast, focus was on children’s and cultural programmes. In the first years, broadcasts were not transmitted every day of the week, and based on agreement with DR (the Danish Broadcasting Corporation) and TV 2 (Danish government-owned broadcast and subscription television station), SVF filled in the programme schedule by retransmitting their programmes. There were no resources to translate these programmes into Faroese.

The range of programmes was gradually expanded to include more Faroese news and current affairs programmes, sports and transmissions from religious services and meetings. In 1997, the Gekkurin bingo was launched, which provided significant extra annual revenue. SVF entered into the first Faroese public service agreement with the authorities in 1998. Broadcasts were transmitted every evening of the week, but the television news were broadcast four times a week.





Kringvarp Føroya – Broadcasting Service of the Faroe Islands


From the beginning, Kringvarp Føroya (KvF) operated according to a model similar to that of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and other public service media in neighbouring countries. The first public service contract was concluded with the authorities in 2011, and the concept of public service was gradually expanded from being of an educational nature in the service of society and the public to also being in the service of the people. In addition to current programmes, great focus is on children’s programmes. The radio broadcasts exclusively in Faroese, and on television, the Faroese programmes are supplemented with mainly Nordic public service programs which have not been translated into Faroese. Revenue comes mainly from licence fees, which are now charged as a tax. The Gekkurin bingo still provides a significant supplement. Revenue from advertising goes into a public service pool that other media have access to.





Other electronic media


Radio station Lindin was founded in 2000 and today broadcasts Christian programmes around the clock. The revenue comes from supporters and various enterprises.

Over the years, a number of attempts have been made to establish radio stations with associated internet programmes based on advertising revenue and sponsorships. However, these did not survive for long. The most significant was R7, which emerged in 2015 as a more centreright and regional alternative to KVF. R7 stopped at the end of 2020 and was replaced by Radio.fo, the objectives of which are the same as R7.

Religion and religious communities on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	The census on the 25th of May 2020 showed that 79.1 % of the population were members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. There were large local differences. The lowest membership percentage was found in Norðoyggjar eastern parish at 62.1 % and the highest was found in Norðurstreymoy’s eastern parish at 91.3 %. The declining membership numbers can be ascribed to a large number of Free Church members, growing secularisation and an increasing influx of residents with other ethnic and religious backgrounds.





The Evangelical Lutheran Church – from the Reformation to the year 1800


Parish clerk service in Sands Kirkja 2nd Sunday in Advent 2021. Note the red ribbons that restrict access to the pews as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. JÁKUP REINERT HANSEN The exact year in which the Reformation was introduced in the Faroe Islands is unknown; but it is known that Jens Gregersøn Riber was appointed superintendent in 1540. He was appointed bishop of Stavanger in 1557, and the Faroe Islands became a deanery under the Diocese of Bergen. When the trade on the Faroe Islands passed to Copenhagen in 1620, the deanery was placed under the Diocese of Zealand. When the Diocese of Copenhagen was established in 1923, the Faroe Islands were included.

The ecclesiastical structure seemed to find its shape after the Reformation and remained unchanged for the next 350 years with a total of 39 churches and seven parishes: Norðoyggjar, Eysturoy, Norðurstreymoy, Vágar, Southern Streymoy, Sandoy and Suðuroy. The seven vicars each had their own vicarage, and in 1632 they were also granted annexefarms bestowed on a clergyman’s widow – also known as ‘mercy-farms’. These served as dower houses or residences for the curate and could be granted by the bishop for reasons of age or illness. Most curates took over the office upon the death of the vicar, and therefore a great deal of continuity is seen in the parish service. The Lutheran vicarages became part of the cultural landscape, and many people can trace their family back to one or more significant vicars.

With the many small villages and remote islands, the vicars did not have the opportunity to visit all their parishioners very often. Some churches were visited by the vicar six times a year and others only two or three times. When the vicar came to the church, he held a service with confession and communion, baptism, presentation of privately baptised children and churching (the ritual at the church the first time a woman went to church after having given birth), marriage and funeral. If anyone had died and been buried since the last time, the vicar would officiate at the graveside ceremony. Confirmation was introduced in 1736, but even before that time, the vicars had to supervise the Christian education of children.

A large part of church life had to be left to voluntary lay people. Usually, there were two churchwardens at each church who, besides being responsible for the maintenance and finances of the church building, also presided over the regular service with the reading from a book of sermons in the absence of the vicar. The vicars started keeping church registers around the year 1700. The preserved probation registers from the same time document the widespread use of reading among the population with a large and varied supply of religious books in private ownership. This primarily applies to hymnals and book of sermons, but also catechisms and prayer and devotional books. As a result, the spread of the Lutheran doctrine and the high level of education of the people can be ascribed to home education and reading just as much as the efforts of the vicars. Over the centuries, theological directions and trends reached the Faroe Islands both through the vicars and through the books that were read. A royal decree on the lay service from 1765 following a book gift to all churches meant that the orthodox piety with Brochmand’s sermons (originally from 1635‑38) and Kingo’s hymn book from 1699 came to influence the population right up to the 20th century.

The ecclesiastical administration was the responsibility of diocesan authority consisting of a bishop and prefect, both of whom were in Copenhagen. Locally, the Faroe Islands had an administrative officer and a dean, who were appointed by the king on the recommendation of the vicars and the vote of the bishop. The vicars met in Tórshavn at ólavsøka for the annual clerical conference with an opening service, and the dean announced the laws and decrees that the bishop had sent with the spring ships. If major personal cases were to be dealt with, a consistory court was set up.





The Evangelical Lutheran Church – from the year 1800 to today


In 1990, the Faroe Islands became an independent diocese, and Havnar Kirkja in Tórshavn became the cathedral of the Faroe Islands. The photo shows a confirmation in the church in 2007, the same year that the Evangelical Lutheran Church passed to home rule. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN When the Faroe Islands became a Danish administrative district after the Treaty of Kiel in 1814, it brought about a number of changes in the ecclesiastical matters. The vicar positions were now filled with young men who returned to Denmark after five or six years, just as the deans could expect a good position in Denmark after a period on the islands. Among the currents that the young vicars brought to the islands were both rationalism, romanticism, Grundtvigianism and the folk high school movement. However, in particular the dawning nationalism and the sense for the uniqueness of the Faroese language should be mentioned. The Danish Bible Society, which was founded in 1814, published Pastor Schrøter’s translation of the Gospel of Matthew in 1823. At an early stage, the church was directly involved in the fight for the mother tongue, and permission to increasingly use Faroese as the language of church service was given in the versions of the act on parochial church councils that came into effect from 1903 after consideration in the Løgting. The necessary books were largely due to the dean J. Dahl, who translated both the Church Order (authorised in 1930), The New Testament (1937) and the Service Book (1939). His two volumes of Faroese sermon collections for use at the parish clerk service were published in 1934 and 1948. Although Faroese hymns were already written in the 1890s, the first Faroese hymnal was not authorised until 1956, while the entire Bible was available in translation from the original languages in 1961. The Faroese Bible Society was founded in 2012 and is about to authorise a new translation.

The act on parochial church councils placed responsibility for the church buildings and their finances with the parochial church councils, and an act from 1924 placed supervision with the Løgting. In 1995, an association of members of the parochial church councils was founded. This gave the established church democracy a voice in relation to the country’s authorities and it publishes the magazine Kirkjutíðindi.

The desire for greater independence of the church was seen throughout the 20th century, but only gained ground in 1963, when the Faroese dean was appointed vice-bishop under the bishop of Copenhagen. In connection with the episcopal election in 1990, the position was changed to bishop, and at the same time, the Faroe Islands became an independent diocese in the established church of Denmark with a dean of the cathedral, deanery councils and diocesan authority. At ólavsøka in 2007, the Løgting took over both the administrative and financial responsibility for the Evangelical Lutheran Church, and the entire legislation was gradually updated with Løgting acts. The tasks relating to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which according to Danish legislation are undertaken by the king, are now divided between the Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands – the løgmaður – (appointment of bishop and dean, authorisation of the church’s holy books) and the minister for cultural affairs (appointment of vicars, establishment and change of parishes and offices, etc.). In addition to the bishop and dean, there were a total of 26 vicars in 2020, including a diocesan vicar and a prison and hospital chaplain. In 2021, the country’s first integration vicar was appointed. A vicar responsible for the Faroese in Denmark is employed under the Diocese of Copenhagen. The total budget for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 2019 was just under DKK 70 million, and the Løgting’s share of this accounted for 13.6 %. The diocesan authority now consists of the bishop, a civil servant appointed by the minister for cultural affairs and a member elected by the parochial church council members. The vicars are predominantly Faroese and if not, they must be able to demonstrate an adequate understanding of the Faroese language after two years of employment. When it is not possible for the vicar to preach, parish clerk service is still held in most churches.





Home Mission – the evangelical branch of the Established Church


Around the year 1900, the Home Mission began its work in the Faroe Islands, first with Danish vicars and from 1904 with posted home missionaries. From 1924, the local work was led by a community council under the central board in Denmark. In 1990, the community council became the central board of the Faroese Heimamissiónin and took over responsibility for the work, and this work, focusing on the Home Mission, children and youth, the Missions to Seamen and the Foreign Missions, still takes place under the framework of and in collaboration with the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Today, the Home Mission has a number of employees, a total of about ten full-time employees, including four home missionaries and one seaman missionary. There are 35 mission houses spread across the country and local work is carried out in another ten villages. The work is managed from the large camp centre in Nesvík, which was established in 1993 and has several large meeting rooms and space for 250 overnight guests. Similar work, Kirkjuliga Missiónsfelagið with mission houses in Tórshavn and Klaksvík, was founded in 1947 and focus on the foreign mission. There are independent YMCA and YWCA departments in Tórshavn with their own buildings. A number of the Faroese vicars have a personal connection to the ecclesiastical association work.





Other religious communities outside the Evangelical Lutheran Church


Shortly after freedom of religion was introduced with the Danish Constitutional Act of 1849, emissaries from other churches and religious communities visited the Faroe Islands, including the Catholic Church. Most of the large evangelical religious communities, of which there are quite a few in the Faroe Islands, are free and independent churches and congregations. People belong to a movement or direction without being organisationally or structurally part of a traditional church community. In general, these free churches focus on personal conversion, the importance of the Bible for the individual and the personal Christian life. The first free church movements came to the country in the mid-1800s. Quakers from England came to the Faroe Islands on a mission trip in 1862, and they held meetings in large parts of the country. However, no church was established after this visit.





The Catholic Church


Mariukirkjan, the Catholic church in Tórshavn. The mosaic window with the title ‘Maria Stella Maris’ at the entrance is made by Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen, who also painted the altarpieces in the parish churches in Húsavík, Hestur and Hoyvík. MARITA GULKLETT, 2009 The Catholic Church was established in Tórshavn in 1857, and a church was built in 1859. As early as 1871, however, the work had to be abandoned. At the behest of Cardinal van Rossum, who visited the Faroe Islands on his way to Iceland in 1929, two Franciscan sisters were sent in 1931. In the same year, they opened the country’s first kindergarten, in 1933 a church was inaugurated and in 1934 a private independent school. The large building complex near the centre of Tórshavn, which also housed a convent for the up to 23 nuns, was designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð and is still there. The municipality took over the school in 1985, after a new monastery had been built in 1980. There are now five sisters left. The Mariukirkjan church next to the monastery, designed by Árni Winther and decorated by Faroese and Danish artists, was inaugurated in 1987. The congregation, which is part of the Catholic Church in Denmark, had 270 members in 2019. A good third of them were Faroese, while the others represented 24 different nationalities.





Brøðrasamkomur (the Brethren congregations, Plymouth Brethren)


In 1865, the Scottish missionary William G. Sloan of the Plymouth Brethren movement began his work in the Faroe Islands. Two decades after Sloan’s arrival, the movement started to grow, and today Brøðrasamkomur has about 5,500 members and 29 congregations spread over most of the islands, and it is by far the largest free church in the country. In recent years, these congregations have become less uniform, especially in terms of meeting types. The largest congregations are Ebenezer in Tórshavn, Betesda in Klaksvík and Lívdin in Hoyvík. Activities closely associated with the Brethren congregations include the large camp centre Zarepta in Vatnsoyrar and the private independent continuation school Brúgvin in Skálavík.





Charismatic free churches


The church of the Pentecostal movement City Church in Tórshavn. The buildings of the free churches are simple and functional and without special references to traditional church architecture, just as the liturgical form of the service is free. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 The charismatic movement began in the United States in the 1960s. In the Faroe Islands, this revival affected a large part of Christendom, primarily within the Evangelical Lutheran Church, and it had particularly strong influence in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1980s, a large conference tent in the small village of Gøtueiði became the centre of the charismatic revival, which continued until the mid-1990s. Afterwards, meetings and other activities were moved to free churches and a few mission houses, e.g. the Lebanon mission house in Sørvágur, which was an active part of the movement.

The free churches Soli Deo Gloria in Klaksvík, Oasan in Hoyvík and Keldan in Skálafjørður have their roots in the charismatic movement. The latter is the largest charismatic free church in the Faroe Islands; it was established in 1987 and is believed to have 300‑400 members. The church runs a private independent school with about 100 pupils.





Pentecostal congregations


The first missionaries from the Pentecostal Movement came to the Faroe Islands in the 1920s. It was Swedish missionaries who visited the Faroe Islands on their journeys to Iceland, and the first was Erik Åsbö. The first Pentecostal congregation was established in Tórshavn in 1936 by the Norwegian pioneer T.B. Barratt. Examples of congregations that have their roots in the Pentecostal Movement are Filadelfia and City Church (formerly Evangeliihúsið) in Tórshavn and Húsið Vón (formerly Betania) in Skopun.





Salvation Army


The international movement, the Salvation Army, came to the Faroe Islands in 1924. There is a corps in Tórshavn and one in Vágur. The Salvation Army carries out extensive social work and helps, for example, the homeless and young people who have challenges with alcohol and drug addiction.





Other free churches


Other free churches are Lívsins Orð in Saltangará, Karis in Klaksvík, Immanuel and Gleðiboð in Hoyvík and Fríkirkjan við Gjónna in Miðvágur. The Adventists ran a private independent school at Hoyvíkstjørn in Tórshavn from 1966 to 2014. The church in the same place dates back to 1978 and replaced an older building in the town from the 1930s.





Non-Christian religious communities


Statistics Faroe Islands only registers religious affiliation for members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. However, in connection with the 2011 census, 94 % of all people over the age of 15 took the opportunity to state which faith or religious community they belonged to. 126 persons indicated that they were members of Jehovah’s Witnesses, who have several Kingdom Halls, 23 were Muslim, seven were Hindu, 66 were Buddhist, 12 were Jewish, 13 were Baha’i, three were Sikh, while 1,397 stated that they were not believers. After 2010, both an atheist and a humanist association were formed.





Victor Danielsen


Group picture of teachers graduating from the Faroese Teachers’ School in 1914. The then 20-year-old Victor Danielsen can be seen third from the left in the front row. 3350F10549, TJÓÐSAVNIÐ Victor Danielsen (1894‑1961) was born in Søldarfjørður, where his father was a sheriff. He was the youngest of seven siblings. The mother died in childbirth, and an aunt stepped in as caregiver.

Victor Danielsen graduated as a teacher from the Teachers’ School in Tórshavn in 1914 with the best exam of the class, only 20 years old. He was strongly spiritually influenced by the evangelical preacher J.C.V. Ryving-Jensen.

After being a teacher for half a year, he left teaching to become a missionary. In 1915, he left the Evangelical Lutheran Church and became part of the Brethren congregation, and in 1916, he was baptised in the fjord off Søldarfjørður.

For the rest of his life, he remained a very central and active figure in the Brethren congregation. In 1920, he married Henrikke Olsen, who was also from Søldarfjørður and in 1928, the couple moved to Fuglafjørður, where they lived for the rest of their lives.

Victor Danielsen spent much of his time traveling around the Faroe Islands as a missionary. In addition to being an excellent orator, he was also an author and a translator. He wrote two novels with religious content and translated a large number of books for both adults and children. He also translated about 900 hymns and songs, most of which in the Brethren congregation’s songbook, and composed more than 30 hymns.

In 1934 he began translating the Bible, first The New Testament and later The Old Testament. The Bible in its entirety was sent to print in Oslo in 1939, but the German occupation of Norway prevented the printing work. After a revision, the Bible was finally printed in the Faroe Islands and was published in 1949. Victor Danielsen continued his work as a missionary, author and translator until his death and became very important for the Faroese language.

Languages and dialects on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 This impressive 63 cm wide document contains certified copies of six letters written between 1403 and 1405 collected in a diploma recorded in 1407 in Tórshavn. These letters known as Húsavíkarbrøvini (the Húsavík Letters) are about one of the Faroe Islands’ richest women, Guðrun Sjúrðardóttir, and her hereditary estate. When the woman in Húsavík on Sandoy died in 1405, she left no heir to her properties in the Faroe Islands, Shetland and Norway. Today, the document is part of a collection of diplomas from the Norwegian kingdom (incl. the Faroe Islands, Shetland and the Orkney Islands) in The Arnamagnaean Manuscript Collection at the University of Copenhagen and bears the signature ‘AM Dipl. Norv. fasc.’. SUZANNE REITZ/THE ARNAMAGNAEAN MANUSCRIPT COLLECTION, 2014 Faroese is traditionally classified as a West Nordic language along with Norwegian and Icelandic as opposed to East Nordic (Danish, Swedish). Such a classification is based on a historical perception of linguistic kinship. Faroese and Icelandic are often referred to as island Scandinavian languages as opposed to mainland Scandinavian. In recent literature, Faroese is classified as the Central Nordic language as structurally, it has an intermediate position between West and East Nordic. The oldest linguistic memorials are two runic stones from about the years 1000 and 1200. The language form of the youngest (Sandavágssteinurin) is classic Norse with preserved ð, þ and y as well as old diphthongs, au, and no svarabhakti sound, maðr. In modern Faroese, the diphthong au has changed to ey, and the svarabhakti sound has been inserted before the final r (maðr > maður). The sounds ð, þ and y do not exist in modern Faroese pronunciation. However, ð and y is used in orthography, which is historical.

The oldest sources, which are written in Latin letters, date back to late 1200s. The legal provision Seyðabrævið (The Sheep Letter) from 1298, which is an addendum to the Norwegian Gulating Law, contains some words that are not found in any other Norse literature, e.g. hagfastr (about sheep that stay in their particular pasture), styggr (wild, untamed) and lemba (lamb). At that time, the language was still Norse, and it also is in documents from the early 1400s, but in Seyðabrévið, changes are seen which give the texts a more Faroese character. Faroese innovations from this time include: skilgitin (older: skilgetin, ‘born in marriage’), fingid (older: fengit ‘got’) and girða (older: gerða ‘enclose, fence in’). Another change, the roots of which can be found in the early 1400s, is the so-called skerping (eng.: sharpening), which is a consonantal insertion (ggj or gv) after a vowel or between vowels, e.g. oy > oyggj ‘island’, trú > trúgv ‘faith’. An example of this change is tvá > tóa ‘two’, which later develops into tógva. A similar trend is seen in the word þrír > þríir ‘three’, which later changes to tríggir.

Major changes have occurred in pronunciation since the Middle Ages, both in vocalism and consonantism. One of the major changes was the quality change as a result of which long monophthongs were diphthongised, e.g. /i:/ > /ui:/, and old diphthongs had their sound value changed, e.g. /au/ > /ey/. Another innovation is the change in quantity, where originally short vowels were lengthened before short consonants, and long vowels were shortened before long consonants (consonant compounds).

In the 1500s, the official written language became Danish, and all written communication was in Danish. Thus, for example, cadastres and land registers were written in Danish. However, they can still provide interesting information about the Faroese language. In 1584, the following was written about the village of Kirkja on the island of Fugloy: ‘Fugløe Ad Kircke’, where the old preposition at ‘at’ was used together with the name. Later, at and á have merged, so the preposition today is á. In 1584, the village name við Norðskála was written ‘Norden vedt Schalle’, indicating that the name of the village at that time was Norður við Skála (which, by the way, makes good sense).

Faroese manuscripts from the 18th century onwards are written in dialect with phonetic orthography. The pioneer was the enlightener and cultural figure Jens Chr. Svabo. In the 1770s, he started a Faroese dictionary and made a register of Faroese ballads. In his written works, he devised his own phonetic orthography. This writing tradition continued through the 19th century, until the Faroese standard orthography, also known as Hammershaimb orthography, was launched.

The standard Faroese orthography was launched in 1846 as the result of a joint Nordic project in the spirit of Scandinavianism. The protagonist was the Danish professor N.M. Petersen whose view was that a dialect could never become a written language. Instead, orthography should unite the different dialects in a common written form and thus be above the dialects. In this process, N.M. Petersen won the support of Norwegian P.A. Munch. This point of view obviously had to end with a historical, etymological orthography. One of the project participants, the Icelander Jón Sigurðsson, was given the task of Icelandifying a phonetically written Faroese text, i.e. give the text an archaic touch. This text was to be published in Annaler for nordisk Oldkyndighed (Annals of Nordic Antiquarianism). When the linguists had commented on Jón Sigurðsson’s text, the material was submitted to Faroese V.U. Hammershaimb because it seemed only natural that a Faroese should have the final say in such a serious matter. V.U. Hammershaimb accepted Jón Sigurðsson’s proposal, and in Annaler (Annals) from 1846, the first Faroese text was published with the orthography that is today called the Hammershaimb orthography. This orthography is used today, albeit with some changes from 1954. One of the consequences of the historical orthography, which is based on medieval Faroese, is that the spelling insufficiently reflects the pronunciation. Therefore, in 1889, Jakob Jakobsen made a proposal for a phonetic orthography, but it was not accepted. In 1895, a compromise was attempted which was also not accepted.

Faroese has no official spoken language standard; therefore dialect use is accepted in public contexts. Faroese consists of many dialects, some of which can be traced back to the Middle Ages. The dialectal differences mostly apply to phonetics. Generally, the differences between the dialects in geographical areas tend to be evened out, while in turn regional languages emerge which cover larger areas. This process takes place in step with the expansion of the traffic infrastructure, the establishment of central schools and as a result of an increasing use of the standard written language, which serves as catalysts in the levelling of dialects. Faroese generally have a positive attitude towards dialect and dialect use, and there is no indication of a dialect hierarchy.

Purism came into use in the late 1800s, at the same time as people really started to use Faroese in writing. This was manifested in the newspapers, e.g. Føringatíðindi, where the editors and readers experimented with Faroese substitute words instead of foreign words. The scepticism towards foreign words was particularly expressed in the Faroese edition of the Copenhagen Observatory’s almanac from 1898, which included scientific articles. The attitude towards purism is generally positive, and it still leaves its distinct mark on the language in dictionaries, glossaries, personal names, in the media, etc. However, a more pragmatic attitude towards purism has been seen in some dictionaries over the last thirty years.

However, the purist ideology has also been criticised. In the 1970s, the term setursføroyskt (university Faroese) arose, which was a negative term for the ‘pure’ language with a clear reference to the linguists at Fróðskaparsetur Føroya (University of the Faroe Islands). The association Málfelagið is a movement whose purpose is to combat purism and to achieve greater acceptance of the informal colloquial language as it is expressed in everyday speech. Such acceptance can reduce the gap between the informal spoken language and the more formal written language. After purism had emerged as an ideology and up through the 20th century, diglossic features emerged in the Faroese vocabulary, where the purist innovations belong to the acrolect and the imported words belong to the basilect.

Film on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 Viaplay’s TV series Trom is based on Jógvan Isaksen’s crime series about the journalist Hannis Martinsson, played by the Danish actor Ulrich Thomsen. The series created new opportunities and connections for Faroese film workers.

TROM/KYKMYNDIR/REINVENT STUDIOS, 2021 Although the Faroe Islands are a new film country with young talents waiting in the wings, the Faroese film history is older than initially assumed. The first film recordings were made by the Danish Ole Olsen in 1907, when Frederik VIII was on a trip to Iceland and called on the Faroe Islands along the way.

At the same time, Ólavur á Heygum had established a cinema in Vestmanna. He had bought a cinema projector in Trondhjem in Norway from the itinerant Heinrich Carl Köpke. Á Heygum, who was fascinated by electricity, hydropower and telecommunications, had in 1905 laid the first telephone line from his home village Vestmanna to the capital Tórshavn. His assistant was Andreas Niclasen, called Dia á Bø. When á Heygum stopped his cinema business in Vestmanna in 1909, the colleague took over and moved the equipment to Tórshavn. Along Tórsgøta, which was later designated as the municipality’s cultural street, the cinema operated in a house that was also a sailor’s school and a soap outlet.

Havnar Bio opened on 28 July 1961 with a showing of North West Frontier in widescreen and cinemascope.

SVEND POULSEN/TJÓDSAVNID, 1963 The first verified Faroese recordings on 35 mm film were made with a lightweight Kinamo camera with Jena Tessar lens, owned by Julius Høgnesen from Oyndarfjørður. Together with his cousin, Ingvald Olsen, he filmed the royal visit to Tórshavn in 1926. Several of the recordings with this camera that are available at Fornminnissavnið were used in an anniversary edition in connection with Tórshavnar Kommuna’s democracy celebration in 2009. Since then, the Faroe Islands have been the backdrop when foreign filmmakers called on the islands to film.

The first film is the black-and-white Swedish silent film Farornas Ö (Great Dimon: Viking decendants on the Färö Islands), which baron Sten Nordenskiöld and photographer Ragnar Westfelt shot among the residents of Skúvoy, Stóra Dímun and Miðvágur in the summer of 1929. The feature-length film was first shown to an audience at Röda Kvarn in Stockholm on 31 March 1930.

Without industry or financial opportunities, Faroese filmmakers have relied on the opportunities of cooperating with Denmark and the Nordic countries to make films, where the foreign actors have had the artistic and production management.

Local business people in Tvøroyri invited Leo Hansen for a visit to make the commercial documentary Færøfilmen (The Faroe Islands) (1930), and after the war, the documentarian Jørgen Roos shed light on agricultural life in Gaarden hedder Vikagarður (The Farm Called Vikagardur) (1947). In 1965, Knud Leif Thomsen filmed the visual artist Steffan Danielsen on Nólsoy, while Ulla Boje Rasmussen composed contemporary portraits of the residents of Gásadalur (1990) and on the island of Mykines (1992). Later, she summarised the political independence negotiations in the film Færøerne.dk (Rugged road to independence) (2003).

Jørgen Roos got the visual artist Jack Kampmann and the author William Heinesen to write the text for the film Færøerne – Føroyar (1961), which was awarded the golden Evreux prize. In the 1970s, a similar collaboration between Denmark and the Faroe Islands arose, when the authors Gunnar Hoydal and Steinbjørn B. Jacobsen wrote the script for a Danish-produced film for the Danish Broadcasting Corporation.

Other foreign feature films that have used the Faroese nature as a backdrop are the East German DEFA production Schatten über den Inseln (East Germany, 1952), Selkvinnen (Norway, 1953), Tro, håb og trolddom (Denmark, 1960), Barbara – wild wie das Meer (Germany, 1961), Barbara (Denmark, 1997), Dansinn (Iceland, 1998), Buzz Aldrin, hvor ble det av deg i alt mylderet? (Norge, 2011), Submergence (Germany, 2017), Fågelfångarens Son (Sweden, 2019) and No Time to Die (Great Britain, 2021).

With a rare eye for detail, Jákup Andreas Arge filmed the daily grind of the 1960s, especially when the locals were harvesting the cornfields. In the early 1970s, the Faroese production company Tór Film discussed the present and the three authors William Heinesen, Christian Matras and Heðin Brú in the documentary film Tríggir varðar (1977). In the mid-1970s, Spanish immigrant Miguel Hidalgo gathered local actors and made the three feature films Rannvá (1974), Páll Fangi (1975) and Heystblómur (1977) on an amateur basis. Furthermore, he himself made an experimental horror film in a Catholic church crypt.

Sjónvarp Føroya has so far produced very few Faroese feature films. These include Alfred (1986) by Eir í Ólavstovu and Stjórin er á floti (1987) by Øssur Winthereig.

In the late 1980s, the Danish director Henning Carlsen tried his hand with a new collaboration with William Heinesen on Don Juan fra Tranhuset. The Danish Film Institute refused to support the project on the grounds that the director was too old to capture the erotic glow of the literary original. The Faroese film club, Filmsfelagið, was involved in the decision. Since 1962, Filmsfelagið has organised showings of artistically interesting films in Havnar Bio and in Leikhús Bio in Sjónleikarhúsið in Tórshavn.

Katrin Ottarsdóttir is the first Faroese film director to have made a name for herself on the international stage. In 1989, at the 8th Official Nordic Film Festival in Tórshavn, she showed the first feature-length Faroese fiction film, Atlantic Rhapsody, to an international audience under the auspices of Filmsfelagiðs. Shot in 16 mm and blown up to 35 mm for cinema distribution, it is a kaleidoscopic story consisting of 52 scenes from Tórshavn. The festival was featured in Variety, and Derek Malcolm from The Guardian compared the film to Woody Allen’s loving portraits of Manhattan. Atlantic Rhapsody won first prize at the festival Nordische Filmtage in Lübeck in 1989.

After the turn of the millennium, Teitur Árnason heralded a new approach to Faroese film art with the poetic depiction of his native town Burturhugur (2002) about life in Hattarvík on Fugloy. The film premiered at the internationally ambitious Listastevna Føroya in the Nordic House.

Since 2005, Klippfisk has been a municipal gathering place for young film workers in Tórshavn. Ever younger Faroese have since worked with the film medium and presented new film art, mainly in the short format. Among the first talents was Sakaris Stórá with the short films Passasjeren (2009), Summarnátt (2012) and Vetrarmorgun (2014). For Summarnátt, Stórá received the Geytin award, instituted the same year. The award is named after the agronomist Herálvur Geyti, who until 1976 travelled to villages without a cinema to show films. Together with Tórshavnar Kommuna’s audience award, Geytin has revived interest in domestic film production and established connections with foreign film festivals. Andrias Høgenni is the film artist who has received it most often.

In 2014, the Faroese Ministry of Culture decided to support Faroese film workers, in 2015 with an amount of DKK 700,000. In 2016, DKK 1.5 million and in 2019, DKK 2.6 million were granted. Since then, the grant, which is managed by two consultants, has not increased.

In 2017, Sakaris Stórá was able to present his first full-length feature film, Dreymar við havið. The film received excellent reviews in the Faroese press and was mentioned in the Faroese Government’s newsletters abroad.

A Faroese Film Institute was established in 2018 with support from the Ministry of Industry, and Minister Poul Michelsen appointed Danish Tina í Dalí Wagner as Head of the Film Institute. The purpose of the Faroese Film Institute is to support a Faroese film industry and to promote the Faroe Islands as an attractive film location. In addition, a local reimbursement scheme is to make it attractive for film crews to transfer productions or parts thereof to the Faroe Islands. This proved to be a success with Wim Wenders and his film Submergence already the year before the opening of the Faroese Film Institute and finally with the James Bond film No Time to Die. Although the Faroese elements in the films are barely seen, the Faroese Film Institute as a public institution is highly important in spreading knowledge of the Faroe Islands as a film country.

G! Festival


trap.fo



	 	 Festival guests enjoy themselves in hot tubs at G! Festival at Syðrugøta in July 2018. In the background is the schooner Norðlýsið, which is a regular visitor to the festival.

MARINE GASTINEAU/RITZAU SCANPIX In the 1990s, an unusually large number of musicians in Gøta wanted to take their music a little further than they had done so far. In 1998, they instigated the association Tónleikasamtakið GRÓT, whose purpose was to improve the conditions of musicians. Since its foundation, the association has had a great impact on the entire Faroese music scene, and several of the big names have their origins in this community. These include Eivør Pálsdóttir, Høgni Lisberg, Marius Ziska, Clickhaze, Boys in a Band and Orka.

During a concert tour in the Nordic countries in 2002, the rock group Clickhaze decided to try to organise a music festival in the Faroe Islands. It was to take place on the sandy beach in Syðrugøta and to be called G! Festival – and already on July 19th of the same year, the festival became a reality. The initially small festival was a success, and the following year they played for high stakes with several foreign names. The festival gradually got bigger every year, and in 2005 a peak was reached when, in addition to the 6,000 paying visitors, 2,000‑4,000 people listened to names like Europe, Nephew and Afenginn from the outfield or boats on the fjord.

Interest in holding music festivals spread to other parts of the country, but the G! Festival has maintained its special position. In terms of the size of the festival, the village in which it is held is quite small. The inhabitants put a lot of effort into welcoming the many visitors and thus contribute to the unique spirit repeatedly noted by the international press.

G! Festival has had its musical and economic ups and downs and has also been challenged by the weather. In 2010, a foundation was created to be in charge of operation, and in 2015, the founder and manager, Jón Tyril, decided to step down. But the festival continues.

Music on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	In 2007, Danish Nephew visited the G! Festival. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN The musical life of the Faroe Islands relates both to historical roots and to the styles and genres of the outside world. Until the beginning of the 1900s, the genres were ballad and hymn singing, and the traditional chain dance was in retreat by the end of the 19th century due to the islands’ increasing connections with foreign countries. The church rituals were characterised by hymn singing without an organ, also known as Kingosang, where the congregation would sing without a harmonic and rhythmic foundation. The Havnar Kirkja cathedral in Tórshavn had its first organ in 1831, and the introduction of the instrument in the other towns and villages meant that folk church singing was gradually replaced by ordinary church singing during the 20th century.

Today, traditional music is expressed in several genres. One hears direct reuse of historical material in the folk metal band Týr’s version of the ballad Ormurin Langi from 2002 and in the doom metal band Hamferð in their version of the hymn Harra guð títt dýra navn og æra from 2010. The traditional material is also reworked by several contemporary classical composers, by the internationally renowned soloist Eivør and by folk bands, such as Harkaliðið and Enekk.

The choral and musical society, Thorshavns Sang- og Musikforening, was founded in 1889 by the music teacher and enthusiast Georg Casper Hansen, called Bager Hansen, from Bornholm. From the beginning, the society included chamber music, brass music and choral singing, and the theatre hall in Tórshavnar Klubbi became the association’s regular haunt. Out of this grew the brass band Tjaldur, which was founded in 1901, and which later changed its name to the Havnar Hornorkestur. The orchestra has retained functions in connection with the annual procession at ólavsøka and at Christmas in Havnar Kirkja, where brass music is always heard on 25 December. The GHM wind band was established in 1922 in memory of Bager Hansen. Brass and wind music subsequently became a regular cultural event in several of the large villages and towns.





Choral singing


Choal singing can be said to be the Faroese’s favourite musical pastime. In 1925, organist, composer and teacher Jógvan Waagstein took over the leadership of Thorshavns Sangog Musikforening, which in 1933 changed its name to Havnar Sangfelag. And several of the larger villages also excelled in choral singing. Toftakórið, which was founded in 1935 by the charismatic teacher and song composer Hans Jákup Højgaard, whose recordings still fill part of the programme schedule in Kringvarp Føroya, is thus a significant exponent of traditional Faroese choral music. The choral singing of the Brethren congregations was also heard early in the century at Sangkórið í Betesda, Klaksvík (1926) and Sangkórið í Ebenezer, Tórshavn (1936). Since 1967, Kórsamband Føroya has organised choir festivals, which are held every year on several of the islands. The driving force was choirmaster and music teacher Ólavur Hátún. At the festivals, music by older Faroese composers, such as Højgaard, Waagstein, Petur Alberg, as well as modern music by Pauli í Sandágerði, Kári Bæk, Leif Hansen, Bjarni Restorff, Tróndur Bogason and Sunleif Rasmussen is performed. Tarira, Tórshavnar Kamarkór, Tórshavnar Mannskór and Kór Gøtu Kirkju are significant current choirs. The major choir event is held during ólavsøka, where a choir of about 250 singers sing in front of the Løgting at the opening of the parliamentary year.





Symphonic music


The symphony orchestra, Føroya Symfoniorkestur, was founded in 1983, the same year as the Nordic House was inaugurated. Under the direction of Bernharður Wilkinson, the orchestra performs classical works, recent modern Faroese music and collaborates with rhythmic musicians. The orchestra was behind the first performance of Sunleif Rasmussen’s first symphony, Oceanic Days, which won the Nordic Council Music Prize in 2002. Aldubáran is an ensemble that was founded in 1995 by newly qualified classical musicians and aims to play new Faroese compositional music. The ensemble has 14 members. In 2006, they organised the performance of the Faroe Islands’ first original opera Í Óðamansgarði with a libretto by Dánjal Hoydal based on William Heinesen’s short story Den gale mands have (The Madman’s Garden) and with music by Sunleif Rasmussen. Classical music also has its own festival, Summartónar, which has focused on new music and the concert venue since 1992. This is the place to experience music in traditional concert rooms, buildings, churches and in natural concert halls in the form of caves and other open-air locations.





Jazz


Jazz came to Tórshavn in the early 1920s. The jazz ensemble Goggan is legendary in this regard; Sjónleikarhúsið in Tórshavn, which was completed in 1926, was the group’s regular venue until the mid-1970s. The big band, Tórshavnar Stórband, was founded by saxophonist and music teacher Brandur Øssursson in 1972. The band changed its name to Tórshavnar Bigband in 1994 and plays both modern and traditional big band music together with foreign and Faroese musicians and conductors.

Havnar Jazzfelag was founded in 1976 by the immigrant Kristian Blak. The Perlan venue in central Tórshavn became home to the club and to progressive music in Tórshavn. In continuation of this, the Tórshavnar Jazz, Fólka og Blues Festival (Tórshavn’s Jazz, Folk & Blues Festival) was organised in 1984 and has been called Vetrarjazz since 2009. The music publishing house Tutl was founded in 1979 under the auspices of the jazz club and today, Tutl releases a wide range of musical genres. Two municipal venues have opened in Tórshavn: the new Perla in 2014 and Reinsaríið in 2017. Together with the bar and venue Blábarr, they provide the framework for rhythmic music in the town. Here you can hear Plúmm, Yggdrasil, Gø and other recent Faroese jazz artists and progressive musicians.





Pop and rock music


Pop music started to gain ground in the mid-1950s with groups such as Tey av Kamarinum, Simme and Ljómlið writing their own material. The Faroe Boys, with the charismatic Robert McBirnie as frontman, was the Faroe Islands’ first supergroup with success in Iceland and in the Faroe Islands, until they disbanded in 1967. The 1970s were characterised by progressive currents within rhythmic music, where groups such as Straight Ahead and Hjarnar from Klaksvík was the centre with the prolific rock musician Jørgen Dahl as the driving force and composer.

In the same decade, folk music also made a breakthrough with the group Harkaliðið, the troubadour Kári P., who wrote socially and politically critical songs, and Hanus G. Johansen, who composes melodies for Poul F. Joensen’s poems. In the 1980s, the folk-rock groups Frændur, Terji and Føstufressar dominated the sound scene with melodic songs that have become very popular. At the same time, the well-produced and synthbased music gained prominence with the group Les îles Féroé and producer Óli Poulsen.





Festivals


G! Festival in Gøtu, which emerged from the music community GRÓT, is a festival and platform for new progressive rhythmic music. Most progressive Faroese names have performed at the festival, for example the group Orka with Jens L. Thomsen, which plays exclusively with electronics and alternative instruments, and Byrta with the songwriter Guðrið Hansdóttir and Jens Rasmussen, as well as internationally recognised soloists and groups, such as Lena Andersen, Eivør, Teitur and Hogni. The summer festival, Summerfestivalurin, in Klaksvík with about 10,000 visitors is the country’s biggest musical event. The festival is held in August and has since 2004 been intended for the popular and nostalgic, and it has been a platform for big foreign and Faroese names. Foreign and Faroese country music can also be heard at the country festival, Countryfestivalurin, in Sørvág, including Faroese artists such as Hallur Joensen and Kristina Bærentsen. In Tórshavn, summer is marked by two festivals around ólavsøka: Voxbotn and Tórsfest, which each year provide the stage for popular Faroese and foreign names.





Three composers and songwriters with an international outlook


Sunleif Rasmussen was born in Sandur and composes works for classical ensembles from solo works to symphonies. He graduated from the Royal Danish Academy of Music in 1995 and has since won a number of awards, including the Sonning Talent Prize for young artists in 1991, the Danish Art Foundation’s three-year work grant in 1997 and the Nordic Council Music Prize in 2002; the latter for the symphony Oceanic Days. His style ranges far and wide within the new compositional music both in terms of technique and meaning. In his works, he allows the Faroese nature and singing tradition to appear as musical mirror images, for example in the form of the whistling of the wind played by a woodwind player, a cacophony of birds reproduced by string players or intonations with unmistakable references to hymn and ballad melodies.

Sunleif Rasmussen was a co-founder of The Association of Faroese Composers – Felagið Faroese Tónaskøld – and has, among other things, been a teacher at the teacher’s educational programme in Tórshavn from 2004 and a teaching lecturer from 2010. In 2019, he was a cofounder of the creative education in music and literature in Tórshavn.

Eivør Pálsdóttir received the Nordic Council Music Prize in November 2021. MARTIN SYLVEST/RITZAU SCANPIX Eivør Pálsdóttir was born and raised in Syðrugøta and began her singing career as a young teenager in the rock band Clickhaze. In the 2000s, she worked with Faroese and Nordic musicians. Her first album was the jazz and folk-influenced Eivør Pálsdóttir (2000), and two years later she worked with the international group, which released the self-titled album Yggdrasil (2002). In 2003 she released Krákan, and in connection with the anniversary of The Danish Radio Big Band, Trøllabundin (2005) was released. With Larva (2010) and Room (2012), electronica became a significant part of her musical universe. In addition to the series of albums, Eivør has written music for several films.

In Eivør’s music, tradition is manifested in the vocals being the absolute centre of the music. In the concert situation, original music and paraphrase of traditional melodies are emphasised by hand drums, dance and movement as well as the distinctive soprano voice. In her compositions she makes use of old melodies, and linguistically she moves between English, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish and Icelandic. Several of her albums have been released in different languages.

Eivør received the Nordic Council Music Prize in 2021.

Teitur Lassen was born and raised in Tórshavn. A singer-songwriter, he broke through with his debut album Poetry and Aeroplanes in 2003, and the breakthrough led to a lengthy and busy tour of the USA and Canada. In 2006, he received two Danish Grammys for the album Under the stars and won the title Denmark’s best singer.

On the album Káta hornið from 2007, Teitur sings in Faroese; the address The Happy Corner, to which the title refers, is in many respects central and significant for music life in Tórshavn. This was where the town’s most important café, Kondittaríið, and music shops were located. The Singer from 2008, whose universe is based on scenes from the artist’s own life, further contributed to Teitur’s international recognition both among audiences and critics, and the same applies to Story music and I want to be kind from 2013 and 2018, respectively. Teitur has also collaborated with various international artists, and he has written music for films and TV series as well as works for classical ensembles and choirs.

Theater on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 Scene from the play Elektra at Tjóðpallur Føroya. Pending the construction of a new national theatre, the Faroe Islands’ national stage is housed in Tórshavn’s old dairy. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2017 The earliest plays known in the Faroe Islands are described in Jens Christian Svabos’ account of a trip to the Faroe Islands in 1781‑82. He wrote that young people in Tórshavn had performed two of Holberg’s plays, The Political Tinker and The Eleventh of June, and these performances ‘should, according to the place’s best experts, have far exceeded expectations’.

Ryberg’s trade created great activity in Tórshavn from 1767 and also made bourgeois culture flourish; acting was part of this new culture. However, the peace between the United States and England in 1783 meant that the basis of Ryberg’s trade disappeared, and with the trade, most of the bourgeois culture also disappeared, including the interest in plays.

In 1825, the Faroe Islands got the first of a series of young and welleducated chief administrative officer who worked in various ways to modernise Faroese society. In the years 1830‑37, F.F. Tillisch was Chief Administrative Officer, and during this period he painted theatrical scenery which was used for almost 50 years. The scant information we have about theatre in the 19th century gives a good picture of the development towards a more modern society, and it was the bourgeoisie in the new society that took an interest in theatre. They gathered in the theatre association ‘Det Thorshavnske Skuespillerselskab’.

With the introduction of free trade in 1856, bourgeois culture expanded, and plays became a regular part of the Tórshavn cultural scene. On the programme were mostly Danish comedies and vaudevilles written by e.g. Holberg, the married couple Heiberg, Thomas Overskou, Jens Christian Hostrup and Erik Bøgh. The actors had no permanent stage, but played at various vacant premises until 1882 when they were allowed to use the Løgting House as an auditorium.

Everything in the new bourgeois culture was in Danish, and plays, literature and from 1872 also the primary school were in Danish. The Faroese language was constantly losing ground and the backlash came in 1888. At the Christmas meeting on 26 December of the same year, it was decided to found a Faroese association, Føringafelagið, whose purpose was to fight for the Faroese language. The national movement was founded, and it came to shape Faroese history well into the 20th century.

From the beginning, theatre was of great importance to the national movement, and just two months after the association was founded, the first two plays in Faroese were performed in the Løgting chamber. In the coming decades, both Faroese and Danish plays were on the programme, but in around 1930 the final curtain fell on the last play performed by Faroese for Faroese in Danish.

The Sjónleikarhúsið in Tórshavn has been visited by many well-known names over the years. Here it is the lead singer of Uriah Heep, Bernie Shaw, performing together with the Faroese band Deiggj in 2010. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN The national movement was part of a major popular revival. Another part was the establishment of youth associations, temperance associations and village associations in many of the Faroese villages. In several of these associations, plays saw the light of day from around the turn of the century, and when the associations later built village halls, these often had a stage and good opportunities for putting on plays. Outside of the large towns, plays are still performed in these village halls.

The first actual auditorium was built in Tórshavn in 1892. It was the members of the old Havnar Klubbi who took the initiative to build an auditorium as an extension to the club, when the actors were told that they could no longer use the Løgting chamber. The auditorium was the centre for the town’s actors for 30 years, but it also accommodated the music association, dancing, political meetings and public talks. The auditorium provided good opportunities for visiting actors, and in 1893, Emil Wulff was on stage. The theatrical company, Boesen’s Teaterselskab, also made a big impression on the people of Tórshavn when they visited the theatre in the years 1911‑1913. In 1906, the auditorium was used as a cinema for the first time, and in the early 1920s the actors became homeless, as the auditorium was now to be used exclusively as a cinema.

In 1917, people interested in acting in Tórshavn had founded the association Havnar Sjónleikarfelag, and the major task of this association was to build a new theatre. When the theatre, Sjónleikarhúsið, was completed in 1926, a new young generation, including the well-known poets William Heinesen and Hans Andrias Djurhuus, was ready to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the new theatre.

Sjónleikarhúsið was the town’s most important cultural centre for many years, but when the British occupied the Faroe Islands in April 1940, they also commandeered the theatre. When the association got its house back after the war, time had come to set new and higher goals for theatre art in the town. In 1948, the association’s scenographer, Jacob Zahle, was sent on a study trip to Copenhagen, and it was decided to put on bigger and more demanding plays than they had done before.

In 1950, directors were used on the productions for the first time, and five years later, Icelandic Erna Sigurlifsdóttir directed the production of John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. It was the first time that a professional actor was involved in the performance of a play in the Faroe Islands. Eyðun Johannessen, who performed in Of Mice and Men, travelled to Denmark to study and returned home in 1960 as the first professional actor in the Faroe Islands. He was employed at Sjónleikarhúsið, ambitions grew, and an old dream of converting Sjónleikarhúsið into a national theatre became relevant again.

For a number of years, the members of the acting association were in disagreement; some wanted to professionalise the theatre, while others wanted to continue on an amateur basis. In 1977, Gríma emerged as the country’s first professional theatre group, while Havnar Sjónleikarfelag continued as an amateur theatre and in 1979 helped found a central association for amateur theatre, MáF.

Today, MáF has eight member associations. Half of them are old youth, temperance or village associations, while the rest are actual acting associations. These are Havnar Sjónleikarfelag, Klaksvíkar Sjónleikarafelag, Suðuroyar Sjónleikarfelag, Dramaverkstaðið v. Hjørdis Johansen, Ungmannafelagið Royndin in Nólsoy, Ungmannafelagið Virkið in Sandur, Losjan Glotti í Gøtu and Bygdarfelagið Eydnan in Oyrarbakki.

The theatre group Gríma staged performances throughout the country but had no permanent theatre. However, this changed in 1998, when the town council of Tórshavn decided to convert the old dairy in the heart of the town into a theatre. The Løgting supported Gríma’s activities from the beginning, and in 2003, the Løgting decided to found Tjóðpallur Føroya. Tjóðpallur Føroya took over Gríma’s activities in 2005 and continued as the national theatre at the dairy. Since its founding, several plays have been staged every year with large numbers of visitors at the national theatre.

However, the framework for a national theatre was not satisfactory at the old dairy. In 2020, the ministry therefore decided to launch an architectural competition for the right location and shape of the future national theatre.

Eating and dining on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	A single tjógv (dried leg of lamb) and dried fish hung in a hjallur (storehouse) at Tjóðsavnið (Faroe Islands National Museum).

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 Eating in a restaurant is a relatively new phenomenon in the Faroe Islands. The restaurants at the hotels were mostly used by visitors and tourists, and the food was mainly Danish inspired. Young people in education and others who lived in rented rooms could eat in the few boarding houses – everyone else ate at home.

In order to attract the local population, a dedicated hotel keeper in Tórshavn started organising dinners in the evening in the 1970s. In the period 1907‑1992, selling and serving of alcohol in all forms were prohibited, and this was a major problem for the restaurant industry. However, this did not apply to private closed parties or weddings where it was allowed to serve drinks that had been brought along. In Havnar Klubbi (Tórshavn’s Club), which is still active, it was possible to enjoy spirits which had been ‘brought along’ already from 1799, as the members could give the club power of attorney to dispose of the quantity of alcoholic beverages that they were each allowed to import. New private clubs were established, and the members could, to a certain extent, bring guests. Some of the clubs also started serving good food and organising wine tasting evenings.

With the new liquor act in 1992, a retailing monopoly was established where people could buy beer, wine and spirits. Restaurants and pubs could now also apply for a licence to sell alcoholic beverages, and at the same time a more general interest in food and food culture arose. Two Faroese chefs were co-signatories of The Nordic Cuisine Manifesto in 2004. Like many other places in the Nordic region, people began to see the value in local ingredients, to be inspired by elements of the local food tradition and to give them a sophisticated twist.

The resource base for fruit, vegetables and edible plants is limited, but the new cuisine has managed exploit what grows. On the other hand, the Faroe Islands have abundant seafood, be it langoustine, other shellfish and sea urchins. Today, the selection of fish is far greater than the few species that were previously considered edible. To this should be added the lambs, geese and hares grazing in the outfield, as well as the many seabirds .





Traditional dishes


Áarstova is one of several restaurants in old Tórshavn that have been set up in old buildings. One of the classics at Áarstova is slow-cooked beer-braised shoulder of lamb.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 From the late 1800s, many Faroese girls attended home economics schools and worked as maids in Denmark. The Faroe Islands also had Danish-inspired home economics schools, which contributed to the traditional diet being supplemented with more continental eating habits. Today, there is little difference between what is eaten in Faroese homes and elsewhere in the Nordic region, apart from the fact that there are certain traditional local dishes.

There is an old tradition of preservation by allowing both meat and fish to ferment and dry, for which the Faroese weather is perfect. The fermented food goes through a maturing process from fresh to ræst and is characterised by a special umami taste. In the past, lamb and mutton were mainly preserved and dried into skerpikjøt that could be eaten all year round. Fresh lamb from the free-grazing sheep is, however, a culinary equal to the fermented lamb, but although 60,000‑70,000 lambs are slaughtered every year, it is insufficient. Therefore, large quantities of lamb are imported from Iceland and New Zealand. Today, the range of food products in the large supermarkets resemble what you can get in Denmark and the rest of Europe, supplemented with local food products.

Fish dishes include fish cakes and knettir, which are large, boiled fish balls, previously always containing tallow, which are served with potatoes and possibly vegetables. The fish soup knetta is cooked on knettir and vegetables. Another dish is ræstur fiskur, which is slightly air-dried and fermented fish that is boiled and served with boiled potatoes, salted pilot whale blubber or garnatálg, a dip of melted fermented intestinal fat from sheep.

A few weeks after the autumn slaughter, ræst kjøt is prepared, which is slightly air-dried and fermented lamb that is boiled or fried. When it is boiled, the meat is used for soup called røst súpan, with vegetables, often beets. Fermented oven-roasted lamb ribs, riv, is also a favourite seasonal dish, which is also very popular among young people. To this should be added dried lamb and fermented and dried fish. Especially dried fish is a food tradition that is shared with Iceland, Greenland and parts of Northern Norway.

Pilot whale meat is also a common dish and is served with blubber and potatoes. Like dried fish with thin slices of pilot whale blubber, pilot whale meat is on most party buffets.

Bundni Steinurin (The Knitted Rock)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The knitted rock is an example of how old legends and myths are given new life in the form of specific works.

MARTIN N. JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2018 A legend says that in a hole between Sandur and Søltuvík, Gívrinarhol í Sandoy, a blind giantess lived who grinded gold on a mill. A man stole the gold from her, and the giantess called out to her sister, who ran after the man. It is the traces of this chase that can still be seen in the large rocks.

In 2013, Hanna á Reynatúgvu and the textile artist Súsan í Jákupsstovu took the initiative to have one of the rocks covered with knitted Faroese wool. It was agreed to use motifs from the legend in the work, which 20 women knitted during the winter. The stone, which is about 18 m in circumference and 4 m high, was covered in 2014. Weather and wind wear on the wool, so the clothing must be repaired regularly, and in winter it is taken off and stored indoors for the next summer.

The knitted rock has become one of the most important excursion spots for tourists visiting Sandoy.

Tradition and tales on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Traditions are certain actions, tales and customs that are handed down through generations in a continuous movement of gradual change. Traditions and tales are interpreted and given new functions in new contexts and are constantly influenced by new currents in global culture. When talking about a common Faroese tradition, it is important to make it clear that tradition is always a changing story, told with many voices and in interaction with time and environment.





Legends and fairy tales


Thousands of participants joined the 2016 Faroe Pride parade in Tórshavn to show their solidarity with the LGBT community in the country. It is said that as much as 10 % of the population participates in the annual event. TRONDUR DALSGARD/GONZALES PHOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX In the Faroe Islands, as in many other places, many legends and tales associated with events, people and places have been preserved. The oral tradition deals with both real people with special stories and characteristics attached to them and supernatural beings such as hidden people, trolls, nixes and seal women. Tales like these, together with definite folk tales, have been documented in writing since the 18th century, first by visitors with an interest in the subject and later by the Faroese themselves.

Much of this tradition is reproduced in popular ballads but has also been published in books and reused in literature in various ways after Faroese had its own written language in 1846. In recent years, together with material from the Færeyingasaga, they have become the subject of artistic expressions of various kinds, for example many statues and sculptures with motifs from traditional tales are placed around the islands. Among these is the statue Seyðamaðurin á Sondum in Sandavágur, which was unveiled in 2021. This is another way of telling stories and keeping the tradition alive, but the renewed interest is also linked to a growing tourist industry and the desire to create interesting destinations with stories about the place and things to photograph.

Hans Pauli Olsen’s sculpture Seyðamaðurin á Sondum (The Shepherd of Sondum) was unveiled in Sandavágur in 2021. It illustrates the legend of a shepherd who wanted to steal a sorceress’s gown. They fought over the gown, and when it tore at the sleeve, as the church of Sandavágur became visible to the sorceress, she gave up and settled for the rest of the gown. Legend has it that the sleeve was so large that it was made into a chasuble for the church in Sandavágur. JENS KRISTIAN VANG These two motives sometimes collide. General agreement is not always reached on which stories should be told, or on how a certain tale is best represented. Hans Pauli Olsen’s interpretation of the legend of the seal woman at Mikladalur thus triggered a rather heated discussion about whether it was really appropriate for the seal woman, who was a victim of sexual violence and oppression, to turn her face and chest towards the village and the tourists. Wasn’t this a way of objectifying the female body and repeating the abuse in the tale? Some felt that it would have been more appropriate to have her turn her back on the village to commemorate that she actually managed to escape from her abuser, the farmer from Mikladalur. But that motif would hardly have been as popular as a destination. It is also still being debated whether Sigmundur Brestisson, who allegedly Christianised the Faroe Islands, was actually the great hero that the Færeyingasaga makes him out to be. Wasn’t Tróndur í Gøtu, the so-called pagan scoundrel, and the rest of the Faroese in fact both free and Christian when Sigmundur Brestisson placed the islands under the Norwegian king and thereby founded the islands’ further destiny as subjects? Today, Tróndur is seen by many as a symbol of the Faroese desire for freedom and independence, and he has been given his own statue in Norðragøta.

Traditional tales can be used in different ways, and there are many ways to relate to them, depending on the message you are trying to convey. It is therefore unlikely that people will stop telling tales. They are also used in school, where legends and fairy tales form part of the curriculum.





The seal women in Mikladalur


Hans Pauli Olsen’s statue The Seal Woman, standing by the surf and looking towards land, was erected in 2014. It is a significant tourist attraction, but at the same time it has raised questions about representation and symbolism: Should she, in fact, have looked out towards the water and thus turned her back on the village and her abuser instead of turning her gaze towards them? ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 A legend says that seals are actually people who have had an accident or committed suicide at sea, and that on the Twelfth Night they come ashore to shed off their sealskin and dance.

One night, a young farmer’s son from Mikladalur took the sealskin from a beautiful woman. Without her skin, she could not join the other seals back into the sea, so she had to follow him home. He locked the skin in a chest, married the woman and had several children with her. One day he went fishing and left the key to the chest at home. The seal woman found the key, unlocked the chest, put on the skin and disappeared back into the sea.

Some time later, she came to her husband in a dream, the night before the men of the village were to go seal hunting. She begged him to spare her mate and their two seal pups. But he ignored her plea, killed both the mate and cubs and cooked them for dinner. But as he and the men were eating, the seal woman entered in the guise of a troll and cursed them all. She swore that so many of the village’s inhabitants would fall from the cliffs or drown in the sea that the dead could reach around the entire island before the revenge was complete.

It thus became a misfortune for Mikladalur that they defied the seal woman.





Traditions


In older times, certain villages celebrated certain holidays, and this is reflected in the attention given to the holidays today. They had Christmas, New Year’s, Epiphany, Candlemas or Shrovetide villages, and guests from other villages came to celebrate and dance in the respective villages during the various holidays.

In Vágur on Suðuroy, much effort is still spent on making New Year’s Eve a special occasion. A large torchlight procession culminates with a bonfire and the burning of an old boat. In Sumba, also on Suðuroy, they put more effort into Shrovetide, where the all residents of the village meet to hit the cat out of the barrel.

Shrovetide is celebrated in most places by both adults and children, and in many workplaces it is also a day of celebration – however, in some places, the party is held on the Friday before Shrovetide. On Shrovetide itself, the children dress up and go like grýla from house to house and knock on the door to get candy in their bags.

The Faroese chain dance and accompanying ballads are perceived by many as an important part of Faroese tradition. Despite great competition from other dances, it is still performed on various occasions. The Faroese national bird tjaldur (the oystercatcher) arrives at the Faroe Islands around Grækarismessa on March 12. Its arrival, which also marks the beginning of spring and the light, is celebrated with local parades, music and speeches. Although the weather is often bad, scouts faithfully line up to march through their hometown.

Flag Day on the 25th April of marks the recognition of the Faroese flag, Merkið, by British authorities during World War II. On this day, the scouts are joined by members of the local sports clubs, who march with the flag to brass music to the place where the speech is to be given to the many assembled residents. In the speech, depending on temperament and political conviction, the flag can be emphasised as a national symbol of independence or as a unifying emblem. The focus of the speech is therefore often awaited with much anticipation.

Easter week and Easter have long been a quiet church holiday, sometimes with musical events. Good Friday is the most closed day of all in the Faroe Islands, but since the beginning of the 2020s attempts have been made to make it an evening where you can go out on the town like any other Friday evening. On the second day of Easter, the children go out to ‘roll Easter eggs’ in suitable grassy places: They let decorated hard-boiled eggs roll down the hills until the shell cracks. The tradition is believed to have Danish origins.

The summer is characterised by village gatherings, stevnur, with sports events, where the most important thing is rowing races with Faroesetype boats. To this should be added other sports events, art exhibitions, cultural events and entertainment, especially for children. Ólavsøka is the biggest and last summer festival celebrated in Tórshavn on 28‑29 July. Faroese from all over the country and many who live abroad travel to Tórshavn to take part in the festivities. For many, it is a tradition to have an open house, so that friends and acquaintances can come to visit and enjoy food and good company between the other items on the programme. Many gather in the centre of Tórshavn when, on the morning of 29 July, the members of the Løgting walk in procession from the Løgting House to the service in the cathedral and back again all dressed up, many in national costume, and the event is broadcast live on television. At midnight on 29 July, thousands of people again flock to the centre of Tórshavn, Vaglið, for community singing which ends with chain dancing. Since 2012, the LGBT movement has kicked off ólavsøka with a large and festive Pride Parade with thousands of participants on 27 July.

In addition to the various village gatherings, there have been several outdoor music festivals in the past 20 years, which for many people are equally important, and which have both spawned new traditions and forced the traditional village gatherings to rethink their programme.

Late summer and autumn are often marked by traditions associated with sheep farming and hunting for birds and long-finned pilot whales. These activities often take place together with family and friends and are an opportunity to pass on knowledge about traditional ways of obtaining and preparing food.





Chain dance


Sámal Joensen-Mikines’ painting Dansen (The Dance) from 1944. Oil on canvas. The image reproduces the movement and engagement in the content of the ballad seen in the chain dance. The dance does not take place in a circle but is more like a kind of moving labyrinth. And often it is best, if it gets a bit cramped. THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF THE FAROE ISLANDS The chain dance in the Faroe Islands is believed to have developed from the medieval chain dances which were widespread in Europe. In 1616, an Icelandic traveller described the dance as ‘Faroese’, so already at that time it stood out from other dances, even though it was clearly associated with a common Nordic ballad tradition from the 1300s-1400s. The hallmark of the Faroese chain dance is that it is danced to the chanting of ballads in either Faroese or Danish. There are no musical instruments involved and the dance is very much about storytelling. The ballads can either be old Faroese ballads by unknown poets or Danish folk songs, which became very popular and in some villages completely supplanted the Faroese ballads. In the 19th century, several new ballads were composed based on traditional models by known poets.

The dance is led by a lead singer called skipari, who remembers the lyrics and adapts the melody and beat to the dance. He or she begins each verse in the place which is best suited for the simple dance rhythm, which is two steps to the left and one to the right. The other dancers support the lead singer by chanting the rest of the verse and chorus. The ballad melodies are perceived as musical frameworks that are varied and paraphrased, and they are extremely diverse, depending on which villages the performers come from. It is important for the good dance experience that the leader is allowed to lead the dance and thereby control the mood.

The dancers move in a closed circle, which swing around in various wobbles within the circle. The participants gradually all pass each other face to face and show with knowing glances, smiles and gestures their participation in the story. The good dance experience is a fusion of story, melody and movement and a shared engagement in the actions and passages of the ballad. For an outsider, it might therefore be difficult to get an adequate impression of the dance, as the dancers are facing each other and have their back turned to the outside world.

The chain dance was in retreat at the end of the 1800s, when it received competition from international ballroom dances with instrumental accompaniment, at the same time as it faced opposition from religious revivalist movements. The founding of dancing clubs, first in Tórshavn in 1952 and later in several other villages, has made it possible to hold on to the tradition.

Efforts are made to teach the children to dance, and since 1997, the chain dance has been a mandatory activity in primary school; many schools dance with the children during the traditional dance season from Christmas to Shrovetide. Several dancing clubs organise children’s dances in the winter, and every year a dancing gathering for children is held with several hundred participants from all over the country.

Today, there are 17 dancing clubs represented in the umbrella organisation Sláið Ring. Members of the clubs are often engaged to contribute to official visits or as part of programmes for tourists. These shows are often spiced up with old singing games called dansispøl to get a more varied choreography.

In 2020, the chain dance was included in the Faroese inventory of intangible cultural heritage, prepared in connection with the implementation of the UNESCO convention from 2003.





Føroysk klæðir – the national costume


Men, women and children in national costumes at ólavsøka on 28 July 2018. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN With its many sheep, the Faroe Islands have from ancient times been a woolproducing country, both for its own use and for export. Cattle hides and sheepskins have been used for shoes, and the sheepskin has also been used by the fishermen for the protective suit called sjóstúka. The wool has been spun into yarn, woven into wadmal or knitted into various garments, which were of great importance until a few decades ago. Recent years have seen renewed interest in the knitting craft.

Faroese klæðir is today very popular as a full dress and is used on special solemn occasions, e.g. when presenting diplomas, and this applies to both men and women. At ólavsøka 28‑29 July, the Faroese folk costume is widely seen in the streets of Tórshavn.

The folk costume has its origins in the old commoner’s dress, which in its time was also influenced by European fashion trends. It got its current form and composition around the turn of the century in 1900, which is a result of the development of national consciousness; before this, Danish bourgeois party clothes were used. The old traditional finery called stakkur, where skirt and top are made in one piece, had gone out of fashion. The stakkur was worn with silver ornaments (stakkastás) in the form of needles, silver chains, brooches etc., which now no longer had any practical use. At the beginning of the 1900s, the women did not use any silver ornaments on what became the folk costume. The scarf hung loosely down the front, and the silver ornaments that had previously been used with the stakkur, found a new place here. The stakkur has since been revived as a variation of the female folk costume, where the silver ornaments are also used.

Today, the women’s costume consists of an ankle-length skirt, and a shirt, on which the silver ornaments are attached to a vest. Over the shoulders, most have a woven scarf topped with a möttul or mantle. In the earlier commoners’ dress, the striped women’s skirt could have many different colours, but in the national costume, the stripes tend to be limited to red or blue on a black background.

The man’s hat was made of the same fabric as the women’s skirt. Young men wore red hats and older men blue. The blue hat was also used for funerals. The men’s costume consists of kneelength wadmal trousers with silver buttons, long socks and buckled shoes. On top of a shirt, there is an embroidered waistcoat which comes in different colours, e.g. red or black. Most also wear ties, but you also see men with bow ties. A patterned knitted open sweater, often blue, or a kot – a brown wadmel coat – is used as outerwear. When dressing up, the men use a sjóstúka, which is longer than the wadmel coat kot. The name is the same as the fishermen’s sea coat, but the new form of sjóstúka is inspired by the French garment juste au corps, which after a phonetic adaptation became sjóstúka in Faroese. The special hat stavnhetta also belonged to this.

Unlike in Norway, there are no rules for how a folk costume should look. Specially skilled seamstresses make the costumes, and most stick to the traditional main lines, albeit with careful experiments in the stripes of the skirts, scarves and the design of individual parts. The costume is thus not stagnant and a personal touch can be added.

Varmakelda


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur At Fuglafjørður’s southern coast, 18-degree warm water seeps up through a crack in the bedrock. The small spring is called Varmakelda, the hot spring, and it is warm both in summer and winter. Already in Catholic times, i.e. before 1537, the spring was frequently visited as its water was supposed to have healing powers. The powers of the spring were believed to be strongest on the night between the 3rd and 4th of July. The custom of visiting the spring never completely stopped.

Since 1952, Fuglafjørður has held its annual summer festival, Varmakeldustevna, the hot spring festival, on the first weekend of July. The opening of the festival takes place at the spring where people light fires, dance chain dances and give speeches. They also drink from the spring, which, in addition to its healing effect, is also supposed to be an aphrodisiac. You can also bottle water from the spring for later use or for others who need it.

Benthic animals


trap.fo



	 	 Sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) is among the most common benthic animals that live off the Faroe Islands, especially in areas where the bottom is hard.

RIGHTS MANAGED/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2007 The seabed around the Faroe Islands can be roughly divided into the intertidal zone, fjords and sounds as well as the deep water. Within the three areas, the benthic fauna can be divided into different animal communities, each of which is characterised by a few dominant species.

In the intertidal zone, land and sea meet in a changeable environment, where the bottom is exposed at low tide and flooded at high tide. Despite the Faroe Islands’ relatively modest size, tides differ quite significantly in several places. In the west, the difference between high and low tide is thus approx. 1.5 m, and at spring tide even higher, while the tidal amplitude at Tórshavn is only about 20 cm. In addition, the intertidal zone varies with the degree of exposure, just as there can be differences in the salinity of the water.

On the exposed rocky coasts, you can find common barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) and common limpet (Patella vulgata) as well as rough periwinkle (Littorina saxatilis) and flat periwinkle (Littorina obtusata), the latter, however, only in more sheltered areas. Inside the fjords, where the water is often slightly fresher, the intertidal zone is often characterised by banks of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). The mussel banks are habitat for many other small animals; shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) live under stones, and there are also many sand-hoppers.

The Faroese fjords and sounds are rarely more than 100 m deep with a current speed of around 5‑10 cm/s. However, the current varies significantly and is decisive for the bottom conditions in the fjords. Where the current is strong, the bottom is hard as the sediments are washed away. At low current speeds, the fjords, on the other hand, have a softer bottom. Here you will find the 10‑15 cm long orangefooted sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) and the soft coral known as dead man’s fingers (Alcyonium digitatum), together with sea urchin (Echinus esculentus) and green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis). Starfish are also abundant. The two most common species are common starfish (Asterias rubens) and sun star (Crossaster papposus).

In areas with stronger current, the common brittle star (Ophiothrix fragilis) and black serpent star (Ophiocomina nigra) can also be seen. The most common crabs on the hard bottom are the downy hermit crab (Pagurus pubescens) and Atlantic lyre crab (Hyas araneus). Various sea anemones live in shallow waters, while the sandy bottom in the deeper parts of the fjords is home to red whelk (Neptunea antiqua), queen scallop (Aequipecten opercularis), blunt gaper (Mya truncata) and razor shell (Ensis ensis).

In sounds and fjords, stones and rocks are in many places covered by macroalgae, which often form large, extensive seaweed forests. The macroalgae are habitat for a variety of small animals. Colonies of bryozoans grow on the leaves, just like you can find small, colourful nudibranchs together with flat periwinkle (Littorina obtusata) and various species of isopods and sand-hoppers. In addition, spiral tubeworm (Spirorbis spirorbis) often builds its white, approx. 5mm wide, coiled shells on the algae.

As you move away from the coast into deeper water, the bottom changes first to a sandy bottom and then to a softer mud bottom. On the sandy bottom you will find species such as sandworm (Arenicola marina), common whelk (Buccinum undatum) and red whelk, Atlantic lyre crab, various species of hermit crab, ocean quahog (Arctica islandica) and European prickly cockle (Acanthocardia echinata). The softer mud bottom is mainly habitat to various bristle worms and mussels, and it is also here that the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) digs its holes in the sediment. In areas where the current is a little stronger, you can find banks of northern horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus), which generally resemble very large blue mussels. Even further from shore, you will encounter smaller banks of queen scallop. Various sea sponges can be seen in the deep water, and at approx. 500 m, where the warm and cold water meet, you can encounter the deep-water coral Desmophyllum pertusum.

Wildlife in the sea around the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) is among the most common benthic animals that live off the Faroe Islands, especially in areas where the bottom is hard.

RIGHTS MANAGED/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2007 The sea around the Faroe Islands contains a varied wildlife, which in addition to fish and large marine mammals also includes a large number of invertebrates. In the 1920s, Danish biologists carried out a series of studies of the wildlife, and the results were later published in the six-volume work The Zoology of The Faroes. The studies of the seabed were mainly carried out within the 100 m depth contour, where, in addition to a number of demersal fish species, approx. 850 different species of benthic invertebrates were recorded. The seabed was studied again in 1988‑90 in connection with the Biofar project. This time the seabed was studied at a depth of 100‑1,000 m. So far, the studies have identified 1,570 different species of invertebrates, but as all the samples have not yet been analysed, the number is expected to reach some 3,000 species. To this should be added an unknown number of small pelagic animals as well as around 240 species of fish, 24 species of whales and the grey seal, which is the only remaining seal in the Faroe Islands.





Marine mammals


Marine mammals is a collective term for mammals that spend most of their lives in the sea. Although due to their adaptations to life in water they often resemble each other in appearance, they are not closely related and include several different orders such as whales, seals and manatees. In the sea around the Faroe Islands, marine mammals are represented by whales and seals.

Wildlife on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	A mountain hare (Lepus timidus) sits quietly between the rocks at Sørvágsvatn on Vágar. It is most active during the dark hours of the day, but during mating seasion, it becomes more active during the day. The mountain hare has a great breeding potential and, in the Faroe Islands, it usually has three litters of one to four leveret per year.

THOMAS BILLE, 2021 Just like the plant life, Faroese wildlife is poor in species compared to wildlife on the nearest mainlands, and as for the plants, here too, the size and remoteness of the islands play a decisive role. On land, less than 2,000 different species of invertebrates have been recorded, but exactly how many of them form permanent populations is unknown. In addition, otherwise, large, speciesrich groups of insects are missing entirely on the islands, including dragonflies, mayflies and stoneflies.

In addition to introduced salmon and rainbow trout, there are only five naturally occurring species of freshwater fish, while the mammals are represented by three adventive or introduced species and six species of bat that are only random visitors. And although birdlife may seem rich, the majority of the 334 different bird species recorded on the islands are migratory birds and random visitors.





The immigration of animals and the impact of humans


The painted lady (Vanessa cardui) is a migratory butterfly that migrates north from the Mediterranean region in spring. It is a strong flyer and can reach as far north as the Faroe Islands and Iceland. In some years, it can appear invasive, as in 2019, when painted ladies appeared in large numbers in many places on the islands. The painted lady does not tolerate frost, and the butterflies seen in the Faroe Islands in summer are therefore all migrants from the south.

JOHNNY MADSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2019 Disregarding the adventive and introduced animal species, the number of species in the Faroe Islands is currently in a more or less natural equilibrium where species regularly become extinct and are replaced by other species that immigrate and establish themselves. Before such an equilibrium could be achieved, however, the rate of immigration far exceeded the rate of extinction.

At the end of the last Ice Age, there was hardly any wildlife in the Faroe Islands. As new land emerged from the ice masses and the first plants began to establish themselves, however, the basis for living was adequate for some of the insects, spiders and other small animals that the wind, water and birds constantly carried with them to survive. Over the following centuries, the number of species grew. However, the growth was unlikely to have been constant, it probably went up and down in sync with variations in climate and changes in plant cover.

It is uncertain what wildlife looked like in the period before the first settlements, landnam. However, there is no doubt that landnam is the event which since the last Ice Age has had the greatest impact on the islands’ wildlife. Although the exact dating of landnam is uncertain, and it probably took place over an extended period, archaeobotanical studies confirm that the impact on nature was significant. Since the first humans settled in areas with many birds, it must be assumed that they were already used as a food source back then. Archaeological excavations have revealed numerous bones from sea birds that breed on the mountain sides, and it is natural to imagine that bird eggs were also part of the diet, not least from greylag geese, terns and seagulls, whose nests were easy to get to. The first humans also brought dogs and maybe also cats, just as it was probably also humans who inadvertently introduced the house mouse to the Faroe Islands.

The impact on wildlife has continued since the time of landnam. Although bird hunting has had consequences for birdlife, the number of humans during the first centuries after landnam was so low that they have been relatively modest. As settlement increased, however, the impact increased significantly, both through increased hunting and through the growing impact that pests and livestock, including the many sheep, gradually had on the wildlife and the landscape.

Most striking is the decline in birdlife. Already in Indberetninger, indhentede paa en allernaadigst befalet, Reise i Færøe i Aarene 1781 og 1782 (Reports collected on a most graciously ordered travel in the Faroe Islands in the years 1781 and 1782) (published for the first time in 1959), J.Chr. Svabo reports on the decline in several bird species, and although some species have experienced periods of increasing numbers, a picture emerges of a birdlife that is only a fraction of what it once was. A very clear example is the many places that are named after birds that no longer exist in the area.

Human impact on wildlife is not limited to birds. At Saksun and Tjørnuvík, for example, there used to be waterholes and lakes, which have since been drained and cultivated. This has meant that the insects that originally lived there have gradually been replaced by common species that are adapted to nutrient-rich grasslands.

The equilibrium, which in untouched biological systems is maintained by constant extinction and immigration, is therefore greatly disturbed by human influence in the Faroe Islands. The picture is further muddied by the many non-indigenous animal species that are deliberately or inadvertently introduced to the islands. Today, the number of species of invertebrates introduced by humans thus exceeds the number of naturally immigrated species.





Non-indigenous and invasive species


Today, the Faroe Islands are home to a number of non-indigenous species that humans have either deliberately introduced or inadvertently brought to the islands. Several of these species have had a negative impact on the natural wildlife and plant life and should therefore be considered invasive.

The first humans who settled in the Faroe Islands brought cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and dogs with them. Rabbits have been introduced on several occasions and since the 17th century, rabbits have periodically formed populations on the islands. Today, domesticated rabbits are kept as pets and are often seen running around the villages. The mountain hare was introduced in the 19th century and can now be found on most islands. The house mouse (Mus musculus) probably came to the islands with the first humans, and in 1768, the first brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) were seen. Today, the brown rat can be found on seven of the 18 islands and has probably contributed to the extinction of more than 100,000 pairs of Atlantic puffin, shearwater and storm petrel.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, attempts were made to introduce both rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) and willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) for hunting purposes, but they failed to establish populations. Mute swans (Cygnus olor) were introduced in the mid-20th century and have been kept in the plantations in Tórshavn and reportedly also in Vágur on Suðuroy. They too failed to settle on the islands. However, migrating whooper swans can be seen, and some have been captured and kept, for example, at Skógrøkt (the Faroese Forest Services) in Gundadalur where a pair had cygnets in 2004. Since then, whooper swans have been released in Eiði and Hvalba where they have started to breed.

Historically, amphibians were not found in the Faroe Islands, however, in 2000, common frogs (Rana temporaria) were imported to Nólsoy and kept in an open-air terrarium, from which they escaped and have since established themselves on the island. In 2019, it was rumoured that some Faroese would try to release frogs on, e.g., Streymoy.

The largest number of introduced species are the invertebrates. One of the species that should definitely be considered as invasive is the New Zealand flatworm (Arthurdendyus triangulatus), which appeared in 1982, probably imported with plants from Great Britain. It is now widespread and common. As it feeds on earthworms, it has reduced the populations of earthworm on the islands, which affects processing of the soil and can have a negative impact on agriculture.

In 1996, Náttúrugripasavnið (the Faroe Islands National History Museum) received the first reports on the Spanish slug (Arion lusitanicus) on the islands. The slug can now be found in most villages, where it is a garden pest. However, it does not seem to spread outside housing areas.

The arthropods have also been supplemented with a number of introduced species. Before 2000, there were no common wasps (Vespula vulgaris) or white-tailed bumblebees (Bombus lucorum), but they can now be found in several places on the islands. Species that live inside houses should also be added, including silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) and daddy longlegs (Pholcus phalangioides).





When the mountain hare lost its white winter coat


The wish for a new prey to hunt meant that an attempt was made to introduce hares (Lepus europaeus) from Denmark to the Faroe Islands in 1831‑32. However, the attempt failed since the hares were not able to settle. Instead, attempts were made with the mountain hare (Lepus timidus), and in August 1855 mountain hares from Kragerø in Norway were released at Tórshavn. The mountain hares thrived and the population grew to such an extent that they were also released on other large islands. As recently as 2012, mountain hares were released on Hestur.

In Norway, the mountain hare changes to a white winter coat when winter approaches, and so was the case for the majority of the mountain hares that ended up in the Faroe Islands. However, winter in the Faroe Islands is considerably milder than in Norway, and snowfall is usually modest. In the brown and green landscape, the white mountain hares therefore became easy prey, and the hunt quickly led to extensive selection among the hares. The mountain hares that retained their grey-brown coat in winter thus had a significantly greater chance of avoiding the hunters’ guns, and already in the 1870s the proceeds of the hunt consisted of almost equal numbers of white and brown mountain hares. By 1882, the proportion of white mountain hares had fallen to 25 %, and by 1890 they only accounted for 5‑6 %. The last white mountain hare was shot in the winter of 1916‑17, and today all Faroese mountain hares are brown.

The hunting of mountain hares is still popular and probably also necessary to keep the population down. The sale of hunting rights in November and December also contributes to agricultural operations on the islands.

Fish


trap.fo



	 	Herring generally comes in shoals. Fishing takes place mainly in the Norwegian Sea with pelagic trawls.

LARS LAURSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2013 Of the 240 fish species known from the Faroese waters, 43 belong to the cartilaginous fish and can be divided into 24 species of shark, 14 species of ray and five species of chimaera. All the remaining species are bony fish. Among other things, the distribution of the individual species depends on the food sources and a number of abiotic factors such as temperature, salinity and currents. The fish can also be divided into pelagic species, which swim in the free water masses, and benthic species, which live at the bottom.

Around 14 % of the fish species found on the Faroese plateau are arctic cold-water species such as Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea), Arctic rockling (Gaidropsarus argentatus), greater eelpout (Lycodes esmarkii) and Lutken’s eelpout (Lycodes luetkenii). Boreal species, in other words the species whose distribution extends from the English Channel in the south and north to Tromsø in Norway, make up about 37 % and include Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), European ling (Molva molva), blue ling (Molva dypterygia), lemon sole (Microstomus kitt) and witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus). Six fish species (around 4 %) live in the area between the Arctic and boreal species. About 34 % of the species can be found from the Mediterranean in the south to the boreal region in the north, while the remaining 11 % are East Atlantic species, which reach the northwestern boundary of their distribution at the Faroe Islands. The last group includes species such as sandy ray (Leucoraja circularis), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), poor cod (Trisopterus minutus) and flounder (Platichthys flesus).

The Faroe Islands are also habitat to a few species of freshwater fish. Several of these species periodically appear in the sea. This applies, for example, to sea trout (Salmo trutta), salmon (Salmo salar), threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and eel (Anguilla anguilla).

Among the many different fish species, only 15‑20 species are of commercial importance. Fishing for benthic species is mainly concentrated on three species of cod fish: cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and saithe (Pollachius virens). In 2019, the catch of the three species totalled 47,440 tonnes, corresponding to 83 % of the total catch of demersal fish in the Faroese plateau. Among the pelagic species, only blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), herring and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) are caught, and in 2019 the total catch of the three species was 398,661 tonnes.





Faroe Bank’s large cod


Faroe Bank is located some 75 km southwest of Suðuroy and covers an area of 3,630 km2 within the 200 m depth curve. Since the water masses mostly circulate around the bank itself, a special ecosystem evolves here. For example, the water temperature on Faroe Bank is 7‑8°C in spring and 9‑11°C in autumn, which is 1‑2°C higher than the shelf water above the Faroese plateau.

60 different fish species have been recorded on the bank, where especially the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is notable for its rapid growth. The high water temperatures and a rich food base mean that a three-year-old cod from Faroe Bank weighs 4.2 kg on average, while a cod of the same age from the plateau only weighs around 1.7 kg. In comparison, three-year-old cods from the waters south and east of Iceland weigh 1.9 kg and 0.9 kg on average, respectively, while off West Greenland, they weigh in at a modest 700 g.





The migration triangle


A number of different fish species are so-called migratory fish, which make seasonal migrations to and from specific spawning grounds. After spawning and hatching, the fish fry is often carried passively with the current from the spawning grounds to nursing grounds where food is plentiful and the fry can seek shelter from predators. As the small fish get bigger, they move to the areas where the adult fish live, only to return to the spawning grounds to give birth to their own offspring. The movements of the fish between the different areas are collectively called a migration triangle.

The migration routes vary in scale. On the Faroese plateau, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) spawn from mid-February to mid-April. Cod from the entire plateau gather on a large spawning ground north of the Faroe Islands and a smaller area to the west. The eggs hatch after two to three weeks, and the fry is carried with the current in a clockwise direction towards the coast and into the fjords. The cod fry grow up in the coastal areas, and only at the age of approx. two years do they move out into deeper water. On the plateau, the cod becomes sexually mature at the age of three to four years, after which it returns to the spawning ground where its life began.

Blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) has a similar migration pattern, but here the migration takes place on a significantly larger scale. The fish spawn west of Scotland and Ireland in March, and from here the newly hatched fry drift with the current to a nursing area in the Norwegian Sea north of the Faroe Islands. The blue whiting becomes sexually mature at the age of two, and with the coming of winter they begin to migrate south towards the spawning grounds. When spawning is over, they swim back to the area north of the Faroe Islands. The migration route to and from the spawning grounds means that the blue whiting is sometimes close around the Faroe Islands. Thus, in the period 2000‑20, between 28,000 and 646,000 tonnes of blue whiting were caught from the Faroese sea area per year. On average, the annual catches of blue whiting is around 400,000 tonnes.

Birds on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Two northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) have settled on a bird cliff on Sandoy, where they share the ledge with flowering sea thrift. The northern fulmar did not come to the Faroe Islands until the first half of the 19th century, but is now one of the islands’ most numerous breeding birds. Unlike other seabirds, the northern fulmar stays by the Faroe Islands almost all year round, and apart from a few weeks in autumn, they are a regular sight on the cliffs.

MARTIN N. JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2018 No other animal group characterises the Faroese landscape as birds. On the mountains facing the sea, you can see northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica), along the coast there are flocks of common eiders (Somateria mollissima), in the outfield oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) live, while common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) can be found in the villages all year round. Of the 334 bird species that have been observed in the Faroe Islands, the vast majority are random visitors or migratory birds that pass the islands in spring and autumn on their way to and from the breeding grounds further north. Migratory birds such as sanderling (Calidris alba), red knot (Calidris canutus), goldcrest (Regulus regulus) and garden warblers (Sylvia borin) thus come to visit and stay only briefly on the islands before continuing their journey to the north and south. The number of breeding birds is therefore relatively low, and only approx. 60 different species of birds breed fairly regularly on the islands.

A small flock of Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) on the grassy coastal slopes of Mykines; easily recognisable by their brightly coloured beak, which has earned them the nickname ‘sea parrot’. The iconic bird from the auk family spends its life at sea but comes to the Faroe Islands in March-April to bring the next generation into the world. They have been vital to the birding activities on the islands, and in 1939 the total catch of Atlantic puffin in the Faroe Islands was estimated at 200,000 birds per year.

OLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2008 Several surveys of the Faroe Islands’ breeding birds have been made, but since several species have only been counted once, the numbers are associated with great uncertainty. In addition, the populations of e.g. starlings and rock dove (Columba livia) have never been counted. Not surprisingly, the surveys show that the seabirds dominate birdlife on the islands. Northern fulmar and Atlantic puffin have the largest populations with more than 100,000 pairs each. They are followed by storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), which also have breeding populations that likely exceed 100,000 pairs. Common guillemot (Uria aalge) and manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) also have populations that can be counted in the tens of thousands. While these six species all breed on the coast, other seabirds breed inland. This is the case for e.g. parasitic jaeger (Stercorarius parasiticus), great skua (Stercorarius skua) and red-throated loon and several gull species, which together make up 10,000‑40,000 pairs.

The outfield also serves as a breeding ground for several different wading birds. They were counted in 1981, at which point the breeding population of oystercatcher was estimated at around 10,000 pairs, whimbrel at around 3,000 pairs, common snipe (Gallinago gallinago) at 1,500‑3,000 pairs and golden plover at around 1,000 pairs. Due to the age of the study, the numbers should be read with a great deal of caution, and there are many indications that the populations have since declined significantly. In addition, the outfield is habitat for small birds such as northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis). Starlings are also seen in the outfield, although in much smaller numbers than in the villages.

On beaches and salt marshes, you can often see wading birds such as dunlin (Calidris alpina), purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima), common redshank (Tringa totanus) and common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula). Most are resting migratory birds or overwintering birds, although very few pairs breed in the outfield. The ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), which is a frequent sight on the salt marshes, does not normally breed in the Faroe Islands. In summer, greylag geese (Anser anser) can be found on the lakes and fjords with a total breeding population of around 100‑500 pairs. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator) also breed in the lakes and have a total population of around 500 pairs. The same applies to the red-throated loon and red-necked phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus). However, these are few and far between, and the total breeding population for the two species is unlikely to exceed 50 pairs. All year round, and especially in winter, flocks of widgeon (Mareca penelope) and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) can be seen on the lakes, although they do not normally breed in the Faroe Islands.





The Oystercatcher


An oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) searching for food at the bottom of Kaldbaksfjørður on Streymoy. The oystercatcher is still common in the Faroe Islands, but it is a seasonal pleasure, as it does not arrive from its winter quarters in the south until mid-March, and it leaves the islands again in September.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2012 With its red bill and black-white plumage, the oystercatcher or tjaldur, as it is called in Faroese, is one of the Faroe Islands’ most easily recognisable waders. It can be found on virtually all the islands, but has experienced a significant decline throughout its habitat. The iconic bird is the national bird of the Faroe Islands, which is largely due to Fuglakvæðið (The Bird Ballad) that Nólsoyar-Páll wrote in 1806‑07. In the chorus of the ballad, the oystercatcher is described as the bird that protects the weak from the strong:

Fuglurin í fjøruni við sínum nevi reyða mangt eitt djór og høviskan fugl hevur hann greitt frá deyða, Fuglurin í fjøruni. The bird on the beach whose bill is so red Without it had many creatures and the proud birds met their death, The bird on the beach.

With its arrival, the oystercatcher traditionally heralds the coming of spring and is celebrated in connection with Grækarismessa every year on March 12.





Bird hunting


Bird hunter hanging in a line with a net called a fleygastong. Á Skarði on Kunoy in 1898.

JOHANNES KLEIN/NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK Hunting for both birds and their eggs has been of great importance since ancient times. It has been an important part of traditional Faroese diet, in some places perhaps the most important. The birds were mainly prepared fresh, but have also been salted or air-dried and fermented for later use.

These include seabirds such as Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica), common guillemot (Uria aalge), razorbill (Alca torda), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and northern gannet (Morus bassanus), which commonly breed on quite inaccessible bird cliffs. Hunting them requires special equipment and technique, and, in many places, the bird hunters have to climb or be hoisted down the bird cliffs in a line, called a bjargalína. Eggs are collected directly from the ledges or from puffin caves.

Until 1925, common guillemot was hunted on Skúvoy on the cliff ledges using a fyglingarstong with a net at one end. In some places, Atlantic puffin is also hunted by pulling them out of their caves, which is called draga lunda. Northern gannets, which only live on Mykineshólmur, are hunted directly on the cliff ledges, where they are taken one by one. The most common technique is to catch the birds in the air with a fleygastong, which is a long rod with a net at one end. During the 20th century, it gradually became common to also hunt by boat and shoot the birds with a gun, especially common guillemot, razorbill and European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis).

The seabirds’ food in the sea also affects the size of the bird populations, which have declined over many years. Most seabirds today are therefore temporarily protected, but the seabird population is expected to bounce back.

Northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) is still hunted in some places during winter. In August-September, however, it is an annual event that the fat young of the northern fulmar, or nátar, are hunted by boat with a racket as soon as they have flown from the nest and come down to sea. Nátar is a favourite food in autumn that can also be bought at the fish market by the port in Tórshavn. On Mykines, young gannets are still hunted every autumn.

In addition to seabirds, wild geese also used to be hunted, and other birds in the outfield were also eaten. However, this was stopped after a new perspective on nature emerged around 1900 under the slogan »Latið heiðafugler og smáfuglar fáa frið« (Leave the birds that live in the outfield and small birds alone).

The islands of Skúvoy and Mykines have been important places for bird hunting since ancient times and are for the same reason popular tourist spots today.

Whales


trap.fo



	 	Pilot whale hunt near Tórshavn in May 2019. A pod of pilot whales is driven onto the beach by the locals, as has been the practice on the islands for centuries. MARTIN N. JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX Globally, there are 89 known species of whales, of which 24 have been observed in the waters around the Faroe Islands. However, several of them have only visited the Faroe Islands a few times, and even the more frequently seen species typically only appear around the islands for short periods during the year. The most abundant whale species in Faroese waters is the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas), followed by species such as Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus). Of the six species, only the harbour porpoise stays around the islands all year round.

Whales are traditionally divided into two suborders: baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti). The baleen whales often migrate north in spring when the light increases in intensity and the production in the sea increases. The light and rising temperatures lead to a boom in the populations of copepods and krill, which the whales feed on. They also feed on the large shoals of herring, sand eel and blue whiting, which are also preying on the nutritious crustaceans. During their northern foraging, baleen whales are able to cover 80 % of their annual energy needs, part of which is built up in thick layers of blubber. As autumn approaches, the whales head south to the breeding grounds in warmer waters. Toothed whales display greater variation in their migration patterns and are regularly observed in Faroese waters, even in winter. Unlike baleen whales, they typically look for food in deeper waters, where they eat squid and schooling fish.

The long-finned pilot whale is without comparison the whale species most commonly associated with the Faroe Islands. For more than a thousand years, the Faroese have hunted the pods of long-finned pilot whales that pass the islands, and for generations the black toothed whale has served as an vital resource in Faroese households.

The long-finned pilot whale is a medium-sized toothed whale. Females become just under 5 m long and weigh about 1 tonne, while males can become 6.5 m long and weigh just over 2 tonnes. Satellite tracking has revealed that the whales migrate widely in the North Atlantic and can cover distances of 70‑111 km per day. Long-finned pilot whales are seen in Faroese waters all year round, but most frequently in late summer. Most catches thus take place in July-September, when the pods number an average of 80 individuals.

Since whale surveys in the North Atlantic typically only observe pods of around 30 individuals, there is strong evidence that the whales gather in larger pods when they stay around the Faroe Islands. The pods consist of related females of all ages, one of whom leads the pod, as well as their young and a few sexually mature males. At the age of about nine years, the young males become sexually mature and are banished from the pod. The females become sexually mature at the age of seven and have an average of one young every five years. Studies have shown that only about 8 % of the young in a pod have a father from the pod, so females mate extensively across pods. Females can reach an age of approx. 60 years, while mortality is greater in males, who rarely get more than 40 years old. The total population is estimated at more than half a million individuals, making the long-finned pilot whale one of the most abundant whales in the North Atlantic.

Both white-sided dolphin and harbour porpoise occasionally appear in mixed pods with long-finned pilot whales, so they are sometimes also caught during the hunt for longfinned pilot whale. The white-sided dolphin has become more abundant in Faroese waters, and the total population in the North Atlantic is just under 200,000 individuals. Since it has become easy to round up the fast whales by motor boats, the actual catch of white-sided dolphin has increased over the past few decades. Harbour porpoise is also hunted, but now only to a limited extent.

Orca (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) can also be seen around the Faroe Islands. Pods of orca show up at the islands once or twice a year where they are clearly hunting for grey seals. Sperm whales are seen more rarely and only come in smaller pods of adult males.

Among the more peculiar guests is the northern bottlenose whale. It belongs to the bottle-nosed whales and is usually a rare sight. In the Faroe Islands, however, it is well-known because, for unexplained reasons, an average of one bottlenose whale is stranded each year at two villages on Suðuroy. The whales do not go to waste, and according to tradition, the meat is shared among those living in the area.

With a length of up to 30 m and weighing of up to 160 tonnes, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) stands out from the already large baleen whales, and at the beginning of the hunting for large whales, it was the one that the whalers mainly went for. At the end of spring, the blue whales passed through the fjords on the west side of the Faroe Islands, where the whaling boats could lie in wait for the colossal animals. However, the original population was small, and it was not long before catches began to decline. During the first five seasons, 23 blue whales were caught, and in the years up to 1908 the whalers managed to kill a total of 363 blue whales, corresponding to 60 % of the total catch. The North Atlantic population of blue whales currently stands at approx. 3,000 individuals, which is so low that female blue whales have had hybrid offspring with male fin whales in the absence of males of their own species.

After the blue whale, the fin whale is the largest of all whales with a length of up to about 20 m. It is also the most abundant of the large baleen whales in the Faroese waters as well as in the rest of the North Atlantic. During hunting for large whales in 1894‑1968, fin whales made up 68 % of the total catch, corresponding to 7,601 whales. When whaling ceased, populations began to grow again and has now reached 80 % of its original size. Today, the total population of fin whales in the North Atlantic is about 50,000 individuals, of which some 5,000 stay at the Faroe Islands in summer.

The up to 18 m long sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) was also an important prey during the hunting for large whales and the total catch reached 2,258 whales in Faroese waters. However, catches varied considerably from year to year, which was due, in part, to the fact that the sei whales’ northward migration takes place later in the year than the other baleen whales.

The more scarce humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and minke whales have also been caught. Although they are a much rarer sight, the whale surveys that have been carried out six times in the North Atlantic since 1987 suggest that the number of humpback whales in Faroese waters has increased. The up to 15 m long humpback whale passes the Faroe Islands when it migrates from the Caribbean to Iceland and the Barents Sea in spring to forage on capelin and sand eel. During the hunting for large whales, only 255 humpback whales were caught. The catches of the small, around 10 m long minke whales were even smaller. Faroese cutters hunted it over a ten-year period from the mid-1960s, but caught just over 100 individuals. The minke whale or common minke whale, as it is also called, enters Faroese waters when it migrates to and from the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea.





Hunting for long-finned pilot whales


Hunting for long-finned pilot whales has probably been a tradition in the Faroe Islands since the Viking Age, and today hunting is still considered part of Faroese cultural identity. Every hunt for longfinned pilot whale is a big social event in the villages where everyone can participate and where meat and lard are distributed for free and equally between participants and residents. In the past, hunting for long-finned pilot whale also helped to keep famine at bay during the periods when the barren rocky landscape did not produce enough crops.

The long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) migrate past the islands in small and large pods all year round, but most frequently in July and August. When a pod is discovered close to land, a grindaboð (pilot whale message) is sent out. In the past, this was done by lighting fires that could be seen from several villages, and by shouting, rowing across the sounds or running to the nearest villages. Originally, the villagers rowed out to get the whales in wooden boats, but today the pods are driven together and towards land with small, fastsailing motorboats. The boats spread out in a semi-circle behind the pod and drive the whales onto the beach where they are killed. While the boats are now modern, traditional tools are still used during the hunt: loose stones and stones attached to strings, which are thrown into the water behind the whales, ropes with whale hooks to secure the whales, and knives and lances for killing. There are 23 authorised whaling beaches into which it is permitted to drive the whales, and it is the sheriff of the area who, together with four whale drive foremen, is responsible for organising and distributing the catch.

There are records of the pilot whale catches, which go all the way back to 1584, and complete records from 1709, making the pilot whale statistics the world’s oldest catch statistics. In the records, each catch is broken down by location, number of pods and total number of whales. The value of each whale was valued in the unit skinn. Even today, each individual whale is valued, which takes place with an valuation stick with a logarithmic scale, so that participants and residents are assigned the same share, regardless of whether it is a large or a small whale.

The pilot whale catch varies a lot. While in certain years, no or very few whales are caught, there have also been periods with very large catches. Since 1709, an average of six pods with a total of 835 whales have been caught each year. In the past 100 years, annual catches have been between 500 and 1,500 pilot whales. The largest number of whales was caught in 1941, when the total pilot whale catch reached 28 pods with a total of 4,480 whales.

In its latest assessment from 2018, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) classifies the world population of the long-finned pilot whale as least concern (LC), and pilot whale hunting should therefore be considered as sustainable. Seen from the outside, however, the hunt can seem extremely violent when the whales are killed on the beach, so that the blood flows and colours the sea red. Pilot whale hunting therefore regularly leads to loud protests from various, mainly foreign, animal organisations, and when 1,428 white-sided dolphins were caught in Skálafjørður in September 2021, it also lead to internal criticism in the Faroe Islands.





Hunting for large whales


The whaling station við Áir on Streymoy in October 1946. ERIK PETERSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX Hunting for large whales played an important role in the development of the Faroe Islands from a farming community to an actual fishing nation. The first whaling station was built by Norwegians in 1894, and six more stations were built in the following 11 years. On Streymoy, the well-preserved whaling station við Áir from 1905 still stands as a reminder of the introduction of hunting for large whales.

At the beginning, the whaling fleet consisted of up to 17 fishing boats that were in use year round. The first whales that the boats hunted were the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) and the rare North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Over time, however, catches of blue whales began to decrease, so the boats switched to the more numerous fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), which soon made up about two-thirds of the catches. Catches also included sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus).

Catches peaked in 1900, when each boat caught an average of 66 whales, and in 1909 the total large whale catch reached 773 whales. Whaling stopped during World War I and II, and in the inter-war years the annual catch was 19‑53 whales per boat. After World War II, hunting for large whales was resumed from the stations in Lopra and við Áir, and until 1949, the whaling fleet grew to seven boats. The catch was good, and in 1950, six boats jointly managed to kill 432 whales. After that, the catches declined, and from 1954, only the við Áir station was in operation. In 1958, four boats caught a total of just 57 whales. The catch was therefore assessed as unprofitable and temporarily suspended. Already in 1962, however, it was resumed with a single boat from the við Áir station, but since the catches remained small, the operation was stopped again in 1968. The last period of hunting for large whales in the Faroe Islands ran from 1977 to 1984, when the við Áir station was in operation again, now owned by the Faroese Government. During this period, hunting took place from a single boat, which caught a total of 32 fin whales.

Insects and arachnids on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 The painted lady (Vanessa cardui) is a migratory butterfly that migrates north from the Mediterranean region in spring. It is a strong flyer and can reach as far north as the Faroe Islands and Iceland. In some years, it can appear invasive, as in 2019, when painted ladies appeared in large numbers in many places on the islands. The painted lady does not tolerate frost, and the butterflies seen in the Faroe Islands in summer are therefore all migrants from the south.

JOHNNY MADSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2019 The terrestrial invertebrates in the Faroe Islands are represented by insects, arachnids, molluscs, annelids and flatworms. The following describes insects and arachnids, which are the two classes of invertebrates that you are most likely to encounter on the islands.

A total of 1,355 different species of insects have been registered, which are divided into 14 orders. With 374 species, diptera, i.e. mosquitoes and flies, constitute the largest order. The largest number is seen among lake flies (Chironomidae spp.), which in the Faroe Islands comprise 80 different species. Lake fly larvae live in water and are common at the bottom of streams and lakes where they can appear at quite great depths. Another mosquito that has attracted some attention is the heather fly Bibio pomonae, which suddenly appeared in large numbers in Tórshavn in 2018, although, until then, it had only been common on Suðuroy. There are also the ubiquitous blow flies, which are divided into five species, while there are 12 species of crane flies.

Certain diptera are closely associated with domestic animals. This is the case for, e.g., golden dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria), whose larvae live in sheep dung, and sheep ked (Melophagus ovinus), which are flies that live in the wool and suck blood from the sheep.

Hymenoptera include bees, wasps and ants and number 273 different species. The vast majority are ichneumon wasps, the larvae of which complete their development inside other animals, especially butterfly larvae. The ichneumon wasps are often very small and several have no wings. More widely known and easier to spot are common wasps (Vespula vulgaris) and white-tailed bumblebees (Bombus lucorum), which also belong to the hymenoptera and today are found on several of the islands.

It is particularly noteworthy that a total of 227 different species of lice have been recorded. That is not only because different bird species are hosts to different lice, but also because conservationist and nature guide Jens-Kjeld Jensen on Nólsoy has done a marvellous job of finding and recording new species of lice on the islands.

Beetles are represented by 219 species, several of which are closely associated with the fresh waters. Among the most impressive terrestrial beetle species is violet ground beetle (Carabus problematicus), which you will probably come across if you lift stones in the outfield. With a length of 23‑30 mm, the beautifully violet-shining ground beetle is probably not the largest, but likely the heaviest insect in the Faroe Islands.

Some of the 166 different butterfly species that are registered in the Faroe Islands are vagrants that occasionally make their way past the islands. This is the case for e.g. red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) and painted lady (Vanessa cardui), both of which migrate north in the summer months and in certain years can appear in such large numbers that some of them end up in the North Atlantic area. However, they are not able to maintain viable populations in the Faroe Islands.

There are also several endemic species of butterflies, and on hot summer days you can often see various loopers in flight across the infield. In October and right into December, you can encounter the small winter moth (Operophtera brumata). The females are wingless, and you can occasionally be lucky to see them sitting on poles and house walls while they wait for a winged male to come flying by.

Another eye-catching insect is froghopper (Philaenus spumarius), whose nymphs protect themselves from predators and drying out with a layer of foam, called cuckoo spit, while they suck on, for example, marshmarigold. The froghopper is a plant sucking insect together with ticks and aphids, of which 53 species are known from the Faroe Islands.

In addition to the insects, 194 different species of arachnids have also been recorded on the islands. Of these, the mites with 72 species and the spiders with 114 species make up the two largest groups. Among the spiders, however, it is probably only 90 species that have a permanent population on the islands. The most common spider is the orb-wheel spinner (Metellina merianae), which can be found in both infields and outfields. Wolf spider (Pirata piraticus) is also a frequent sight in the outfield where it lives in damp places in fens and along lakes and streams. It is able to run on the surface of the water and can catch its prey both above and below the water.

Plant life on land on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) is common in the Faroe Islands. There are two subspecies, of which one is monoecious with a double chromosome count.

KARSTEN SCHNACK/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2004 In 1967, R.H. MacArthur and EO Wilson published the major work The Theory of Island Biogeography, in which they postulated that the species richness of a given island depends on the size of the island and its distance from the nearest mainland. In short: The smaller and more remote an island is, the fewer species you can expect to find. This perfectly illustrates the Faroe Islands, which, in comparison with the nearest large mainlands, have a fairly sparse plant life. For the same reason, the greatest richness in species is also found on Sandoy, Suðuroy, Vágar, Eysturoy and Streymoy, which are the only islands where more than 200 different plant species have been recorded.

If you include adventive and introduced species, a total of 843 different plant species have been found in the Faroe Islands. Most are mosses (Bryophyta) and angiosperms (Angiospermae), which are represented by 287 and 401 different species.

Like white cotton balls, the woolly seed pods of the common cotton sedge (Eriophorum angustifolium) rise above a damp depression at Fuglafjørður on Eysturoy. The distinctive and easily recognisable sedge is a common plant in Faroese fens, where it grows together with, e.g., bog moss and various species of sedge as well as deer’s grass, purple moor grass and bog asphodel.

MARINE GASTINEAU/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2015





Immigration of plant life


It was not possible to establish plant life in the Faroe Islands until towards the end of the last Ice Age some 11,000 years ago when large land masses began to emerge from the melting ice. It is unknown how the first plants came to the islands, but they probably came as seeds carried by the wind or stuck on seabirds. Studies of the seed bank in old soil layers have revealed that the first plants that came to the Faroe Islands were hardy species that typically grow on bare soil in mountain areas. Early plant life probably resembled the old plant communities found on the western side of Eiðiskollur and on high mountains in the northern part of the country to a large extent, and included species such as eightpetal mountain-avens (Dryas octopetala) and rooted poppy (Papaver radicatum). Today, however, the latter can no longer be found on Eiðiskollur.

As the ice disappeared, species such as fir clubmoss (Huperzia selago), rose root (Rhodiola rosea), purple stonecrop (Sedum villosum) and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides) also managed to establish themselves in the open, gravelly landscape. In the time since then, dwarf birch (Betula nana) also thrived on the islands, even though it was still quite cold.

When the temperature and humidity started to rise some 9,000 years ago, the dwarf birch disappeared and was replaced by common juniper (Juniperus communis) in the dry areas and by various species of willow (Salix spp.) in the more humid areas. As the climate became wetter, different species of mosses (Bryophyta) began to dominate, and while willow thrived, common juniper disappeared.

About 7,000 years ago, the climate became drier again, and heather (Calluna vulgaris) spread over large parts of the lowlands where it replaced the willow scrubs. The heather shared the landscape with various grasses, which have grown well in the Faroe Islands almost since the last Ice Age.

With the first settlements, livestock and cultivation began to leave their mark on plant life. Especially from around 650 AD the islands’ vegetation changed quite considerably, until it became the plant life seen in the Faroe Islands today. The mountain slopes, where the sheep graze, are characterised by short grass vegetation, although in the infield you can still find heath areas with up to about 200 m high vegetation. If you want a glimpse of a more original Faroese plant life, you must seek out places where the sheep do not have access, or which are otherwise inaccessible to the woollen grazers.





Plant communities


Along a stream at Eiði on Eysturoy, the landscape is coloured yellow by flowering marsh marigold (Caltha palustris). Children have made flutes from its stems, it has adorned postage stamps and it is frequently featured in both poems and songs. It is therefore perhaps fitting that the marsh marigold was named the national flower of the Faroe Islands in 2005.

MARTIN N. JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2018 The landscape is diverse, and the variation of the landscape is clearly reflected in the distribution of the individual plant species. Based on aerial photos, habitat types such as grassy mountain sides, heaths, swampy terrain and lakes as well as areas lacking vegetation such as rocky plateaus and areas without grassland have been mapped. The mapping can be used to shed light on the distribution of the individual plant species and to identify how they are distributed in different plant communities.

The largest plant-covered areas are found on the grassy mountain sides. Here, plant life varies with the incline of the slopes, the grazing intensity and the height above sea level. Based on studies of six mountains in the years 2000‑02, botanist Anna Maria Fosaa was able to identify 12 different plant communities, which are divided into four habitat types: shrubs (heaths), wet grassland, open grassland and high mountain vegetation. Two different plant communities can be found on the heaths. One is characterised by heather (Calluna vulgaris) and matgrass (Nardus stricta), while heather and black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) dominate in the other. It is noteworthy that the plant community with heather and black crowberry can only be seen on the south sides of the mountains and only up to 200 m above sea level.

If you move up over 200 m, wet grassland becomes the dominant natural habitat on the mountain sides. Here, three different plant communities have been identified: one with wild thyme (Thymus praecox) and blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) as the dominant species, another characterised by matgrass (Nardus stricta) and common tormentil (Potentilla erecta), and a third where heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) are the most distinctive species.

Further up the mountains, you can find plant communities with viviparous fescue (Festuca vivipara) and either common bent (Agrostis capillaris) or alpine bistort (Bistorta vivipara). In the open grass areas, springy turfmoss (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and wavy hair-grass (Avenella flexuosa) also grow, while island purslane (Koenigia islandica) can be seen in gravel and landslides.

Actual high mountain vegetation only starts to dominate near the mountain tops at an altitude of 500 m. Here, plant life almost becomes arctic with species such as glacier buttercup (Ranunculus glacialis), creeping sibbaldia (Sibbaldia procumbens) and snowbed willow (Salix herbacea). The presence of the hardy large woolly moss (Racomitrium lanuginosum), which allows the plants to take root, is decisive for plant communities at high altitudes. The woolly moss covers the rocks in large pillows and often forms its own plant community. In another of the high mountains plant communities, the moss dominates together with snowbed willow, while in a third it grows together with alpine lady’s mantle (Alchemilla alpina).





Impacts on plant life today and in the future


Since the first immigration, Faroese plant life has been under constant change. Along with changes in e.g. climate conditions, some species have disappeared, while new ones have appeared. This development is also seen today, but has been reinforced with the arrival of humans on the islands. The very intense livestock grazing has left a clear mark on the plant life, but also the human-driven climate change, together with the introduction of non-indigenous plant species, greatly affect the original plant life.

In connection with studies of the plant communities on selected mountain sides, scenarios were proposed for how the plant life will develop if the average temperature rises by just one degree. Even such a modest increase in temperature will probably mean that the plant communities on the lower slopes will spread up the mountain sides, while the communities near the mountain tops will come under pressure and ultimately risk disappearing.

Another significant threat to the natural plant life is the many new plant species that are either introduced deliberately or inadvertently brought to the islands. For example, Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis) formerly a popular aquarium plant, which has spread in nature over time and was found at Tórshavn in 2021, for example. In the same year, butterbur (Petasites japonicus) was found at Fuglafjørður. Both are just examples of a number of new, non-indigenous plant species which more frequently are found growing in the wild and which have the potential to become invasive, i.e. to have a negative impact on the natural, indigenous plant life.

Non-indigenous plant species end up on the islands in various ways. Some are accidentally brought in, while others are grown as garden plants and from there spread into the wild. Today, species such as lady’s mantle (Alchemilla mollis) and hummingbird fuchsia (Fuchsia magellanica) are abundant in many towns and villages, and particularly hummingbird fuchsia is increasingly seen in the wild where it grows in gorges and on rocks where the sheep cannot reach it. Other garden plants also seem to be spreading, and the potentially highly invasive Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) is now growing wild in some towns.





Tree planting in the Faroe Islands


The Havnará stream meanders idyllically through Viðarlundin in Tórshavn. The first trees were planted in 1904, and today the small plantation serves as an urban park and recreational area.

SUNVA EYSTUROY, 2017 There has never been a forest in the Faroe Islands, but after successful attempts at planting trees in Iceland in the 19th century, the question was raised as to whether something similar would be possible in the Faroe Islands. Already in 1885, the city council of Tórshavn had, at the request of the chief administrative officer and with support from the Løgting, tried to establish a plantation in Gundadalur, but the attempt failed when sheep accessed the area and destroyed the plants.

The idea received renewed interest in 1902, when the Faroese member of the Danish Parliament Jóannes Patursson asked the Danish Heath Society for help to explore the possibilities of establishing a plantation on the islands. At the end of July 1902, the Danish Heath Society sent the 29-year-old Christian Emil Flensborg to the Faroe Islands from Iceland where he had participated in the Icelandic tree planting experiments. Together with a report from Flensborg, Patursson submitted a proposal to the Løgting in September 1902 for the establishment of a plantation and a nursery outside Tórshavn. The proposal was unanimously adopted, and the first trees were planted in 1904. This time the trees took root, and today the plantation is located in central Tórshavn and has over time grown around the old tree planting area.

In 1912, the Løgting decided to expand the tree planting experiments, and in 1914, plantations were established in Kunoy, Selatrað and Hoydalar. A plantation was also established in Trongisvágur on Suðuroy in 1924 and another in Kerjum north of Tórshavn in 1934. So far 25 plantations have been established on the islands, and more are on the way.

An actual Løgting act on afforestation, the Forest Preservation Act, was not adopted until 1952 after the Faroe Islands took over the afforestation area in 1948. This act made it possible to preserve several of the existing plantations.

In 1968, the Government of the Faroese Islands employed Leivur Trónd Hansen as the Faroe Islands’ first forest manager, and he would play an important role when the newly established Nordic Arboretum Committee contacted the Faroese Government in 1974 with a request to carry out more planting experiments on the islands. From 1977, the Faroe Islands became an independent member of the Nordic Arboretum Committee, and in 1978 a new nursery, Skógrøktin, was established in Hoydalar near Tórshavn. The nursery is the only one in the Faroe Islands and has, for the past 40 years been responsible for the establishment of numerous gardens with large trees, hedges and planting.

Several of the trees were found in South America by dendrologist Søren Ødum and forestry graduate Tróndur Leivsson, son of Leivur Trónd Hansen, who, among other things, brought home 6,500 tree plants from Tierra del Fuego in 1979. They also went to Alaska in 1981 and 1988 and returned to the southern tip of South America in 1992; each time to collect seeds and young plants of trees that might be able to thrive in the Faroe Islands’ cool and humid climate. Tróndur Leivsson was appointed forester in the Faroe Islands in 1987 and held the position until 2015.

Today, the original plantations have become popular recreational areas. Most are owned by the municipalities, and there is growing local interest in expanding and developing them.

Seals


trap.fo



	 	Illustration from the end of the 18th century, showing the hunt for harbour seals in the Vága district. Both the harbour seal and the grey seal were previously hunted during the breeding season, where they were ambushed on land and killed with clubs. The harbour seal was easier to catch than the grey seal, which breeds in remote caves. ROYAL DANISH LIBRARY Of the world’s 33 living species of seals, seven can be found in the North Atlantic. There used to be two species of seals in the Faroe Islands, but since the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) disappeared in the mid-19th century, the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) has been the only one with a breeding population on the islands. However, several Arctic seals have made their way past Faroese waters from time to time.

Based on genetic studies, it is known that the grey seal came to the Faroe Islands from the British Isles after the last Ice Age some 10,000 years ago. It is relatively large, and the males can reach a length of 2.3 m and a weight of about 300 kg. In Faroese, the grey seal is called »láturkópur«, where »látur« (laughter) refers to the loud sounds that the seals use extensively when socialising.

The grey seal mostly stays close to the coast and rarely goes out where the sea is deeper than 100 m. It is mainly seen on the most inaccessible parts of the coast facing the open sea. Here, the coastal landscape is characterised by steep rock walls, which are intersected by gorges and caves. While grey seals elsewhere give birth to their young in open landscapes on islets, rocks and small islands off the coast, the Faroese grey seal mainly breed in caves in the rocks. From late September to December, the female gives birth to a single pup. The pup has a white fur that is not waterrepellent, and it must therefore stay on land until it molts its birth coat. The pup weighs about 15 kg at birth. The female’s milk is very rich in fat, and during the two-week nursing period, the cub increases its weight to around 50 kg. The female then abandons the pup, which is then left to fend for itself.

Grey seals have been hunted since the first settlements (landnam). The pups in particular were easy prey, as their birth coat prevented them from escaping into the sea. Equipped with torches, people sailed out to the breeding dens in October where they ambushed and clubbed the pups and adult seals to death. The seal meat was eaten and the blubber melted into oil, while the skin was tanned and used for shoes and bags.

In two cases, grey seals were even the object of prize hunting, because, according to the fishermen, the population had become so large that it was affecting their fishing. During a three-year prize hunt in the 1960s, 970 grey seals were killed. In this connection, the total population of grey seals in the Faroe Islands was estimated at 3,000 individuals with an annual production of pups of around 500. Grey seals are no longer hunted, and the Faroese population is currently estimated at around 1,000 individuals.

Arctic seals occasionally stray into Faroese waters as they migrate south. The small ringed seal (Pusa hispida), which is otherwise closely associated with the Arctic ice, has recently been observed in the Faroe Islands twice, just as five ringed seals were reported during the prize hunt in the 1960s. The barely 3 m long and up to 400 kg heavy hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) used to be more common in Faroese waters. During the prize hunt of the 1960s, three hooded seals were killed, and in April-May, hooded seals were often caught by the salmon lines that the fishermen set 100‑200 nautical miles north of the Faroe Islands. The observations are confirmed by satellite tracking, which shows that the hooded seal migrates to Faroese waters in early spring and summer to forage.

In the past, individual harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) were also caught on the salmon lines, and it was also not unusual for them to appear during the seal hunts. However, harp seals have not been seen in Faroese waters recently. On the other hand, several bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) have been observed, which have not previously been recorded in the Faroe Islands. The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) appears only as an occasional guest, and visits are far between. In 2010 and 2013, respectively, two walruses that made their way past the Faroe Islands were tagged so that they could be followed with satellite tracking. The first walrus headed straight back towards Svalbard, where it came from, while the other visited the Orkney Islands, Iceland and Norway before returning to the Arctic Ocean.





Disappearance of the harbour seal


Until the mid-19th century, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) bred in the Faroe Islands, and old accounts tell of a population which was roughly the same size as the population of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus).

With a length of 1.2‑2 m and a weight of 65‑140 kg, the harbour seal is considerably smaller than the grey seal, and unlike its larger relative, it bred in the more sheltered areas inside the fjords. In Faroese, it was therefore called »innanfjarðaði« (the seal in the fjord). The pups were born in May-June on the islets and skerries of the fjords where they spent the three to four weeks that the suckling period lasted.

The easily accessible living and breeding grounds made the harbour seal very vulnerable to hunting, and hunting intensity was high. The most common hunting method was sláa kóp (club the seal), where the seals were killed with a blow to the head with a club. The blubber was particularly valuable and was melted into oil and used for, e.g., lighting. The meat was eaten, whereas the skin was tanned and used for shoes and bags.

Since its disappearance, the harbour seal has been seen in the Faroe Islands several times. They were probably isolated strays from the Shetland Islands, and they have so far failed to re-establish a Faroese population.

Fresh Waters on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Numerous large streams mark the mountainside after rainfall at Tjørnuvík.

BJARNE JAKOBSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2013 The Faroese climate is characterised by considerable precipitation and, on average, it rains or snows for more than 270 days per year. For example, Tórshavn gets more than 1,200 mm of rain per year, while average rainfall in Hvalvík a little further north is as much as 3,200 mm per year. Remote areas such as Mykines and Akraberg are drier and get less than 900 mm of rain per year. It is these vast volumes of water that form the basis for the Faroe Islands’ many fresh waters.

Until recently, it was generally believed that there was no groundwater in the Faroe Islands, and that all rainfall ran over the rocks as surface water and into the lakes, streams and sea. However, the islands do have groundwater which can be revealed by springs that do not dry out in periods without rainfall. In addition, it is assumed that hot springs such as Varmakelda at Kambsdalur are connected to deep groundwater. Groundwater deposits also show as inflowing water in several tunnels, just as they can appear in boreholes in connection with the installation of e.g. geothermal heating.

Like white cotton balls, the woolly seed pods of the common cotton sedge (Eriophorum angustifolium) rise above a damp depression at Fuglafjørður on Eysturoy. The distinctive and easily recognisable sedge is a common plant in Faroese fens, where it grows together with, e.g., bog moss and various species of sedge as well as deer’s grass, purple moor grass and bog asphodel. MARINE GASTINEAU/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2015 Despite the presence of groundwater, a very significant part of the rainfall runs into lakes and streams as surface water, and the effect is usually very evident. During periods of rain, the water level and speed in the streams increase rapidly, while the opposite happens at almost the same speed when the weather is dry. Several days without rain can cause small lakes to dry out, and if there is no rain for weeks, many of even the slightly larger lakes dry out, while the streams shrink into smaller brooks.





Ecological status of lakes and streams


Along a stream at Eiði on Eysturoy, the landscape is coloured yellow by flowering marsh marigold (Caltha palustris). Children have made flutes from its stems, it has adorned postage stamps and it is frequently featured in both poems and songs. It is therefore perhaps fitting that the marsh marigold was named the national flower of the Faroe Islands in 2005.

MARTIN N. JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2018 The amount of phosphorus in the Faroese subsoil is small, and due to the low concentration of dissolved phosphorus, the lakes and streams are predominantly low in nutrients. However, an increased supply of nutrients from agriculture, fish farming and settlements has had an impact on certain lakes and streams. This can lead to increased algae growth, which reduces water transparency and inhibits the spread of aquatic plants, and can ultimately also have a negative effect on wildlife. However, the nutrient load can also come from more natural sources. For example, black-legged kittiwakes often congregate at certain lakes, where their nutrient-rich droppings can lead to nutrient loading of the water.





Fresh water plant and wildlife


Plant life in Faroese fresh waters is relatively modest. Fens are dominated by common cotton sedge (Eriophorum angustifolium), dioecious sedge (Carex dioica) and common black sedge (Carex nigra) and a number of different peat mosses (Sphagnum spp.). Another common Faroese moss is the bright green fountain-apple moss (Philonotis fontana). It mainly occurs in springs, where it often grows together with starry saxifrage (saxifraga stellaris).

The Faroese streams are often so steeply sloped and have such a strong current that the plants have difficulty taking root. However, it is possible to find greater water-moss (Fontinalis antipyretica) in most streams, while smaller brooks, where the current is not so strong, can also feature species such as bog pondweed (Potamogeton polygonifolius) and alternateflower watermilfoil (Myriophyllum alterniflorum).

As you move up to the bank, plant life becomes much more diverse. This is especially true along the streams in built-up areas, where the sheep do not have access. Along, for example, Sandá or Hoydalsá in Tórshavn, you can encounter up to 60 different plant species during summer, including forget-me-not (Myosotis scorpioides) and marsh-marigold (Caltha palustris) as well as invasive species such as European speedwell (Veronica beccabunga) and yellow monkey flower (Mimulus guttatus).

Both lakes and streams are habitats for a variety of insects. Along the streams, you can encounter several species of the brownish, nocturnal moth-looking caddisflies, whose larval stage is completed in the cool, flowing water. Among the Faroese caddisflies, there are both species with larvae that cement grains of sand and gravel together into transportable houses, and species where the larvae sit at the bottom of a silk net that captures the small animals that make up their food. There is also the widely prolific Rhyacophila dorsalis, whose larvae are free-living and hunt prey on the bed of the stream. Lake fly larvae (Chironomidae spp.) also occur in large numbers in the streams, where they constitute an important food source for many fish and birds.

Lake fly larvae can also be found in the lakes, where they can be found on the bottom of even deep lakes. The lakes are also habitat to snails and sand-hoppers, as well as several species of house-building caddisflies, whose larvae, unlike their streamdwelling relatives, most often build their houses from plant parts. In small, shallow lakes, you can encounter beetles such as the large diving beetle Agabus bipustulatus, while water boatmen are represented by two species that swim on their front: Callicorixa wollastoni and Arctocorisa carinata.

The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is abundant in both streams and lakes. The eel (Anguilla anguilla) also occurs in lakes and streams, but has declined dramatically since the 1970s. Moreover, the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) sometimes migrates into streams and lakes, but it cannot reproduce in fresh water.

There is trout (Salmo trutta) in almost all streams. The sea trout, which is an ecological form of the trout that migrates into the sea after spawning, is also found in the Faroe Islands, especially in Saksunarvatn and Sandsvatn. It is popular among anglers and as a food item, and towards the end of the 19th century it was caught in such large numbers that the population declined markedly. Leynavatn on Streymoy has an original population of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and the species has been released in a dammed lake at Vestmanna, from where it has spread to a few other dammed lakes. For the sake of anglers, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has also been released in Nesvatn on Eysturoy.

Although certain streams bear names such as Laksá and Laksará, salmon (Salmo salar) is unlikely to have occurred naturally in the Faroe Islands until Føroya Sílaveiðifelag (the Faroese fishing club) in 1947 began releasing Icelandic salmon fry into the streams. This has led to the islands today having a self-reproducing salmon population.





The utilisation of the fresh waters


The fresh waters are popular among anglers, but are also used as drinking water and for the production of electricity. For example, more than 100 streams from different rainfall areas were led through collection tunnels to the dam at Eiðisvatn in connection with the large hydropower project at Eysturoy. In addition, fresh water is used commercially by, for example, filleting factories and for the production of salmon fry. The total ecological consequences of the extensive exploitation of the fresh waters are still unknown.

Fens on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 Like white cotton balls, the woolly seed pods of the common cotton sedge (Eriophorum angustifolium) rise above a damp depression at Fuglafjørður on Eysturoy. The distinctive and easily recognisable sedge is a common plant in Faroese fens, where it grows together with, e.g., bog moss and various species of sedge as well as deer’s grass, purple moor grass and bog asphodel.

MARINE GASTINEAU/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2015 In addition to lakes and streams, the Faroese wetlands also include a number of fens. Together, they cover 18 km2, which corresponds to 1.3 % of the Faroe Islands’ total area. The origin of the fens varies. Where old lakes have gradually been overgrown by bog moss, basin fens arise, while sloping fens, ‘tilrenningarmýrur’, are formed on mountain sides where the water cannot escape. In the valleys and lowlands, you can also find bogs.

Peat is often formed since plant residues and other organic material break down only slowly in the fens, although the layers are relatively thin. Throughout time, the peat has been cut and dried so that it could be used as fuel, and for centuries peat served as a valuable source of energy in Faroese households.

Today, there is renewed interest in the fens. Not because of peat extraction, but for their ability to bind carbon. This makes them a potential key element in the future climate policy.

Lakes on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 Before Eiðisvatn was dammed in connection with the establishment of a hydropower plant, archaeological remains of a shieling from the Viking Age were found on Argisbrekka. Since then, a study of sediments at the bottom of Eiðisvatn has dated the arrival of sheep and thus people to around the year 500.

JENS CHRISTIAN TOP/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2017 There are lakes everywhere in the Faroe Islands, both in the low-lying valleys and in the high-lying cirque valleys. Most of the lakes are located on Suðuroy, Sandoy, Streymoy and Eysturoy, although the largest can be found on Vágar. In Faroese, large lakes are called ‘vatn’, but the smaller lakes go by names such as ‘tjørn’, ‘dammur’ and ‘hylur’.

Out of the almost 2,400 lakes, the two largest are Sørvágsvatn (Leitisvatn) and Fjallavatn, which are located in the southernmost and northernmost end of the Klovin valley on Vágar. At around 360 ha, Sørvágsvatn is significantly larger than the just 100 ha Fjallavatn. Other large lakes include the 82 ha Sandsvatn on Sandoy, the 51 ha Toftavatn on Eysturoy and the 18 ha Leynavatn on Streymoy. There are also nine lakes with an area of over 10 ha and 51 lakes with an area of 1‑10 ha. The remaining some 2,300 lakes are all smaller than 1 ha.

The distribution and characteristics of the lakes to some extent reflect the landscapes of the islands. For example, Norðoyggjar’s high mountains and steep terrain can explain why the lakes here are small; the largest is Vatnið við Hólminum on Borðoy with an area of just 20 ha. On Sandoy, the lakes are very shallow, which is due to the low mountains and flatter, open landscapes. So even though Sandsvatn is the third largest lake in the Faroe Islands, it is only 3 m deep. In comparison, the significantly smaller Leynavatn on Streymoy is 33 m deep. The deepest lake in the Faroe Islands is Sørvágsvatn (Leitisvatn), which is almost 60 m deep.

Streams on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 Numerous large streams mark the mountainside after rainfall at Tjørnuvík.

BJARNE JAKOBSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2013 The Faroe Islands have around 1,200 streams, which with their associated tributaries have a total length of approx. 2,100 km. They are characterised by generally being short with modest water flow. Accordingly, an average Faroese stream is less than 1 km long and has a water flow of less than 70 l/s. However, these average values cover quite large differences. This is not least true when it comes to the water flow, which can vary significantly depending on the amount of rainfall. In Stóra at Hvalvík, the water flow can drop to approx. 500 l/s during dry periods, but can multiply to approx. 20,000 l/s after hours of rain.

The Havnará stream meanders idyllically through Viðarlundin in Tórshavn. The first trees were planted in 1904, and today the small plantation serves as an urban park and recreational area.

SUNVA EYSTUROY, 2017 The longest stream is just over 7 km long. The stream rises in Loðadalur on Streymoy, from where it runs northeast. At Hóraldstoftarætt, it joins other smaller streams and continues southeast under the name Stóra. On its way towards the outlet in Hvalvík, it runs more or less parallel to the Saksunarvegur road.

The islands’ other long streams also include Sandá, which has its outlet south of the port in Tórshavn; Reyná, which originates at Úti á Dølum in Vestmanna; Kvígandalsá, which joins the Sjatlá stream at Vatnsoyrar; Heltná, which joins Skálafjørður, and Stórá, which has its outlet at Sandavágur.

The streams merge into large interconnected systems that drain large parts of the islands. The stream system with the largest catchment area begins in a brook in Kvígandalur on Vágar. On its way to Sørvágsvatn and on to the outlet at the sea through the Bøsdalafossur waterfall, it drains an area of more than 3,500 ha.

Another large stream system is the Reipsá, which is also the Faroe Islands’ widest stream. The stream system consists of several streams, which from their source in the mountains run to the Fjallavatn lake in the northern part of Vágar. In the north, Reipsá runs from the lake, and on its way to the sea, the stream reaches a width of over 30 m in some places. Shortly before it reaches its outlet at the Reipsáfossur waterfall, it is joined by Gullringsá, which has its source in the Hvilvtkinnavatn lake. On its path, the system drains an area of 2,700 ha.

The Leynará system on Streymoy also has a quite impressive catchment area of around 2,000 ha. It begins in Botn as the stream Dalá, which on its almost 5 km long route to the outlet at the northern end of Leynavatn is joined by countless smaller streams. Leynará runs from the lake in the south and continues for almost 2 km to the outlet at Leynar east of the Vága Tunnel.

Geology on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Cliff on the west side of Suðuroy where the lower part shows the Beinisvørð Formation and the upper part shows the Malinstindur Formation.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 The Mid-Atlantic Ridge on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean stretches from the Greenland Sea in the north and all the way to the waters of Antarctica in the south. The ridge is a socalled mid-ocean ridge, which marks where the tectonic plates move away from each other. Although the ridge is largely submarine, it briefly makes landfall in Iceland where it divides the country in two: a western part, which lies on the North American tectonic plate, and an eastern part, which lies on the Eurasian tectonic plate.

The formation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge began approx. 175 million years ago, but its extension to the north did not occur until much later. This period is associated with the opening of the North Atlantic and is one of the most violent volcanic episodes in Earth’s history. And, at the same time, it tells the story of how the Faroe Islands came about.

Some 62 million years ago, the tectonic plates in the North Atlantic began to move away from each other, resulting in violent volcanic activity. The gigantic volcanic eruptions spewed out large amounts of basaltic lava, which during the following 6 million years created a huge land area in the form of The North Atlantic Igneous Province. Today, this land area can be found in Baffin Bay in Canada, on Disko Island in West Greenland and down the entire East Greenland coast as well as along the eastern part of the North Atlantic from Northern Ireland and Scotland and on to the Faroe Islands.

The lengthy volcanic activity and thus also the formation of the Faroe Islands are linked to the continental drift that began with the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, which separated Europe and Africa from North and South America. The volcanism, which gradually reached the North Atlantic some 62 million years ago, intensified around 58 million years ago in the area between Greenland and Northwest Europe. The reason was that large amounts of magma from a particularly hot part of the asthenosphere began to move upwards to form the so-called Icelandic mantle plume, which some 17 million years ago raised Iceland above the seabed. This led to extremely violent volcanic activity with associated lava production, the likes of which has not been seen on Earth since. The Faroe Islands and the submarine plateau on which the islands lie are the very remnants of these volcanic events.

Stilbite crystals. Stilbite (calcium aluminium silicate) is a zeolite with a microporous, fibrous crystal structure. This property means that it can be used to separate hydrocarbons in the oil refining process. This specimen was found in the Faroe Islands and measures around 110 mm in diameter.

DIRK WIERSMA/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/RITZAU SCANPIX, NO YEAR The Faroese area covers an area of 293,623 km2, of which 99.5 % is sea and just under 0.5 % is land. The area’s land and seabed surfaces are extremely varied with a geology that reflects the tectonics and erosion of a volcanic area over more than 50 million years.

In the first half of the 1990s, hydrocarbon exploration began in the Faroese area. Nine wells have been drilled so far, and although hydrocarbons have been found in some of them, the volumes found have not justified commercial exploitation. On the other hand, the seismic surveys and other methods used in the exploration have greatly contributed to the understanding of the area’s geology.

Deep seismic surveys of the continental shelf under the Faroe Islands and the surrounding regions show that the earth’s crust has repeatedly been stretched considerably in connection with the breaking up of the continent since the Devonian about 385 million years ago. Furthermore, geochemical analyses of the Faroese basaltic layers suggest that the continental crust under the Faroe Islands is from the Precambrian. This means that it is more than 541 million years old and thus of the same age as the East Greenland and Scotland bedrock. The Faroe Islands lie on the edge of the continental crust, which stretches from the western part of the Barents Sea in the north to the sea area west of Ireland in the south. The continental crust is characterised by a series of sedimentary basins that were created during periods when the crust was stretched, as happened, for example, during the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea. It is the boundary between the two oceanic crusts that is volcanically active today (e.g. in Iceland).





Geology on land – the formation of the flood basalts


Vestmanna and the surrounding landscape on Streymoy are characterised by the middle basalt sequence, the Malinstindur Formation, which makes the continuous mountain sides rounded. The clear terraced formation, which is seen in many other places in the Faroe Islands, is almost non-existent. This is because of the numerous, but thin basalt lava flows with only few intervening sediment layers.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 The geology of the Faroe Islands is relatively simple with alternating layers of basalt and volcanic clay and sandstone, which consist of basaltic weathered material, clay slate and tuff. Although the layer sequence is simple, it tells quite a dramatic geological story. The dark basaltic layers testify to violent volcanic eruptions, where basaltic lava layer by layer created the landscape that makes up the Faroe Islands today. The thin intravolcanic layers were deposited in the periods between the volcanic eruptions and contain, for example, plant fossils appearing as impressions and thin carbon films between the often reddish layers of clay and sandstone. The fossils show a subtropical flora and reveal that a lush rainforest grew in the area at this time.

Along Suðuroy’s west coast and north to the northern islands, you can often follow individual basaltic horizons from one island to the next. The layer sequence shows the formation of the original basalt plain, which was created layer by layer in step with the alternating volcanic eruptions and intermediate calm periods. Differences in the types of eruptions and magnitude are revealed by two dominant types of lavas: one type, which is made up of relatively uniform, approx. 20 m thick lava flows (‘simple aa flows’), and a type which is made up of many, often quite thin lava flows (‘compound pahoehoe lava flows’).

The volcanic eruptions which created the lower and oldest part of the Faroe Islands are from the time before the opening of the North Atlantic. These volcanoes were probably fissures, which lay in northwest-southeast direction west of the present location of the Faroe Islands. The fissures have produced enormous amounts of lava with a regularity and to an extent seen only in the formation of basalt plains.





The beginning of volcanism – the Lopra Formation


The 3,565 km deep Lopra borehole on Suðuroy resulted in the description of the oldest known part of the Faroese basalt sequence, which, based on radiometric dating, was estimated to have an age of 60.8 million years. The borehole was carried out in two rounds in 1981 and 1996, respectively, and aimed to obtain lithological and stratigraphic data about the deepest parts of the Faroese basalt sequence and the underlying geological formations. The background for the drilling was predominantly an interest in investigating the possibilities for oil exploration in the area.

The borehole never made it down through the volcanic sequence, and the final thickness of the volcanic layers could therefore not be determined. However, the investigations showed that the Lopra Formation is more than 1,000 m thick and that the rocks alternate between volcanic sandstone and hyaloclastites, which are rocks formed when lava meets water. In the deep part of the Lopra Formation, there are also a number of intrusive rock types.





Pulsating lava formation – the Beinisvørð Formation


The mightiest of the formations in the Faroe Islands is the Beinisvørð Formation, named after a 469 m high cliff on southwestern Suðuroy. The formation was created by a rhythmic production of magma, which was linked to the fissures west of the Faroe Islands. The resulting basalt sequence has a total thickness of approx. 3,250 m, of which approx. 890 m is exposed, while the rest is located underground and was documented in the Lopra borehole. The formation is made up of extremely thick basaltic lava flows, where each flow reflects a period of volcanic activity. The individual basalt lava flows are on average 20 m thick, but reaches a thickness of more than 70 m at Fámjin. Each basaltic lava flow is composed of a bottom crust, a more solid and massive basaltic core and an upper crust that is often fractured and filled with vesicular pores.

Columnar basalts are common in this formation and consist of pentagonal or hexagonal columns that formed as the lava slowly cooled and contracted. Basaltic lava flows with column formation can, for instance, be seen in Froðba on Suðuroy as well as in Korkadalur on the north side of the island of Mykines where the basaltic columns reach heights of up to 30 m. Between the individual basaltic lava flows are reddish sedimentary layers, which become thicker and more carbon rich in the upper part of the formation. This suggests that the periods between individual volcanic eruptions have gradually become longer and longer.

Today, the Faroese area lies east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and thus also east of the mid-ocean ridge zone. This means that the original formation was divided between east and west, and you have to go to the Blosseville area on the east coast of Greenland if you want to experience the remains of the basaltic lava flow that ended up west of the mid-ocean ridge zone. Here they make up the Nansen Fjord Formation, whose exposed parts are to some extent reminiscent of the Faroese landscape.





Lush forests and freshwater lakes – Prestfjall Formation


After the violent volcanic activity and enormous magma production that created the Beinisvørð Formation, a more peaceful period followed with a significant decrease in volcanism. Slowly, the elevated basaltic lava flows began to erode, giving them an uneven surface in which shallow freshwater pools formed. In this landscape, sediments rich in organic material were deposited. It is these organic deposits that form the starting point for the coal seams that characterise the Prestfjall Formation. In addition to coal, the rocks of the nearly 10 m thick formation consist of organic rich claystone and various other sediments.

The coal layers are rich in plant fossils, testifying to a lush plant life in the then subtropical climate. The dominant tree was the giant and now extinct redwood Metasequoia occidentalis, which is known from fossils from all over the Northern hemisphere. On land, dead plant parts became mulch, while the plant parts that were washed together into deep bogs and lakes were transformed into peat. Where the peat was buried and over time came under great pressure, it was converted into coal. The largest coal seams are found on Suðuroy where they cover an area of about 23 km2.

The coals in the Prestfjall Formation are lignite and occur partly as anthracite (vitrite) and partly as dull coal (durite). Anthracite is firmer and purer with a higher calorific value of 6,000 kcal/kg, while dull coal contains more clay and has a calorific value of around 4,000‑5,000 kcal/kg.

People have known about and tried to exploit the coal deposits on Suðuroy since the 17th century. In 1954, the island’s coal deposits were estimated at 12 million tonnes, and in 1958, when coal mining was at its peak, 18,000 tons of lignite were mined here. In addition, there are small coal deposits on Vágar, Mykines and Tindhólmur. On Suðuroy, coal is still mined in a single mine, which also serves as a visitor centre.





Explosive volcanism – the Hvannhagi Formation


Volcanism returned with renewed magma production and this time in an explosive form, leading to the formation of the Hvannhagi Formation. The explosive development in volcanism is probably due to the fact that the rising magmas were met by an eroded, faulted and groundwater-filled subsoil.

The Hvannhagi Formation is exposed on Suðuroy, Tindhólmur and Vágar, where it is partly restricted to depressions in the old landscape. It was previously called the tuff-agglomerate zone, and among geologists there is doubt as to whether it is an independent formation or simply part of the Malinstindur Formation as the two are geochemically identical. The Hvannhagi Formation has a thickness of 20‑30 m in most places, but close to the eruption sites such as in Hvannhagi and on Tindhólmur and Bíggjarskor (Vágar), it can reach a thicknesses of more than 50 m.

The rocks in the formation consist of volcanic eruption products such as ash, lapilli, agglomerates and lava bombs, which were created when lava, ash and slag were flung into the air during the explosive eruptions and then fell close to the volcanic eruption sites. In addition to these volcanic rocks, a number of intrusive rocks such as irregular sills and dikes can also be seen.

In the cliffs at Bíggjarskor and on Tindhólmur, new studies have been able to identify parts of some of the old volcanoes. These volcanoes have been preserved because the subsequent volcanism, which created the Malinstindur Formation, was so productive that the volcanoes were buried before they eroded away.





Interlaced lava flows – the Malinstindur Formation


The eruptions continued with the formation of the Malinstindur Formation, and since there were only very few, short breaks between each eruption, there was an almost continuous, massive spread of lava. Today, the few breaks in volcanic eruptions can be seen as very thin horizons of volcanic sandstone between the basaltic lava flows.

The volcanoes that created the formation were relatively flat shield volcanoes that were much smaller than the large fissures that created the lower and oldest part of the Faroe Islands. They produced numerous interlaced lava flows, the thickness of which varied from just a few centimetres to several meters. In addition, ropy lava often occurs, which is thinflowing lava with an even surface and rope-like wrinkles.

The Malinstindur Formation has an average thickness of 1,350 m. It is thickest to the north and thins somewhat to the south, so that, at Tórshavn, it is only about 1,050 m thick.





The youngest volcanic period – the Enni Formation


The youngest and thus uppermost is the Enni Formation, which is seen in the steep mountains on the northern islands. However, the formation does not occur on Suðuroy, Mykines or Vágar.

In contrast to the older formations, the Enni Formation was created by a combination of lava from both the uniform lava flows and the many, often quite thin, interlaced lava flows. This means that the formation has a varied and often changing appearance.

Today, the formation has an average thickness of around 900 m, but has probably been considerably thicker. Accordingly, studies of the mineralogy in the basalt zeolites indicate that in certain areas as much as 1,000 m of the top of the formation has been eroded.





Intrusive rocks


Coastal eroded landscapes at Ásmundarstakkur on Suðuroy’s west side. The rugged coast testifies to both the current constant wave erosion of the coastal landscapes and how the ice during the still recurring ice ages has cut down through the basalt plain and transformed it into the 18 islands that today make up the Faroe Islands.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 Large sills are formed when magmas penetrate fissures and cavities in old basalt and slowly solidify: numerous basaltic dikes and irregular intrusions bear witness to the most recent magmatic activity in the Faroe Islands. Collectively, they are called intrusive rocks.

The largest intrusions are the 17 km2 Streymoy Sill and the 16 km2 Eysturoy Sill, both of which are clearly visible on geological maps and at the same time are significant landscape features in the landscape eroded by the ice. In the two sills, there is often a well-developed column formation, reminiscent of the columns in the Beinisvørð Formation. In addition, there are several small sills on Fugloy and Svínoy as well as at Morskranes on Eysturoy.

The basaltic dikes were created by a vertical intrusion of magma in fissures through the basalt lava flows. They are very common, and in connection with the preparation of geological maps of the Faroe Islands, more than 800 basaltic dikes have been identified. Accordingly, fissure zones throughout the Faroese basalt plateau are penetrated by basaltic dikes that are typically relatively straight to slightly curved and a few metres wide. Broadly speaking, the orientation of the basaltic dikes varies from a northwest-southeast direction in the oldest basalts to a more east-northeast-west-southwest direction in the more recent basalts.

The irregular intrusions have a more alternating orientation. They have typically formed when magma penetrated the large sedimentary layers such as in the Hvannhagi and Prestfjall Formations, where looser rocks have resulted in more irregular courses.

Both the dikes and sills are made of basaltic material, the mineralogy and appearance of which are reminiscent of the rest of the basalt on the islands. In general, however, the minerals in the large intrusions are coarser, which testifies to a slow cooling that has led to increased crystallization.





Rocks and minerals


The dominant rock type is tholeiitic basalt, whose mineral content can predominantly be divided into two groups: the rock-forming or primary minerals and the secondary minerals. The rock-forming minerals make up the basalt itself and consist of feldspar, pyroxene, olivine and magnetite, which have crystallised directly from the magma, either in the deep magma chambers or solidified on the surface after an eruption.

Based on the distribution of the minerals and their grain size, the basalt can be divided into different types. The fine-grained basalts are called aphanitic basalts, while basalts containing olivine and feldspar grains are called olivine porphyritic basalt or olivine basalt and feldspar porphyritic basalt or feldspar basalt, respectively.

The secondary minerals have precipitated in cavities and fissures in the basalt, usually shortly after the eruptions, and are dominated by zeolites and quartz minerals. The zeolites are hydrous silicate minerals which have crystallised under relatively low pressure and heat. They are quite fragile, and the most spectacular examples are typically found in connection with tunnel work. The quartz minerals occur in different types, the most common of which is chalcedony. In addition, rock crystals, opal and jasper as well as other rarer types of quartz minerals are seen in both the basalt and the sedimentary rocks. Besides zeolites and quartz minerals, you can also find copper, pyrite and celadonite as well as various rarer minerals.

Between the basaltic lava flows you can find layers of sedimentary rocks, which, due to their volcanic origin, are collectively called volcaniclastic sediments. They consist of sandstone, siltstone and claystone as well as coarser conglomerates. The sediments often contain plant fossils, just as a single trace fossil has been found here. Together with the secondary rocks, you will often find hardened ash, also called tephra, as well as coarser volcanic explosive material such as lapilli and volcanic bombs.

Climate on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Overview of the most important ocean currents, winds and fronts in the North Atlantic and in the Nordic Seas, which drive the climatic variations in the Faroe Islands. The abbreviation ‘L’ stands for low pressure. HJÁLMAR HÁTÚN, 2021 Its location in the North Atlantic, surrounded on all sides by strong ocean currents, means that the Faroe Islands have a distinctive coastal climate. A major climate factor is the North Atlantic Current, which is a northeastern branch of the warm and salty Gulf Stream, which runs north along the east coast of North America. At Newfoundland, the Gulf Stream meets the cold Labrador Current, which pushes it away from land. From here, it continues to the northeast as the North Atlantic Current through the North Atlantic to the waters around the Shetland Islands and the Faroe Islands.

The North Atlantic Current is of great importance for the oceanographic and climatic conditions and thus also for the natural resources in and around the islands. On its 6,700-km long journey, it loses much of its heat surplus due to the heat exchange of the surface water with the atmosphere at the same time as cold subarctic water reaches the deeper parts of the current’s left flank. Despite the heat loss, the North Atlantic Current is still so warm that it gives the Faroe Islands a relatively mild climate all year round.

However, the climate is not controlled by the North Atlantic Current alone. The warm ocean current is part of a complex interaction with other ocean currents, which, together with the low pressure systems that form at the atmospheric polar front, play an important role in the climatic conditions on the islands.





Three driving mechanisms on a large scale


Seen in a larger context, the climate in and around the Faroe Islands is controlled by three driving mechanisms: the thermohaline circulation, the oceanic polar front and the atmospheric polar front.





The thermohaline circulation


The Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Current form part of a global cycle of coherent ocean currents that exchange heat between the tropics and the poles. The transport of the large water masses is partly driven by changes in the density of the water, which are caused by differences in temperature and salinity. As the warm Atlantic surface water moves north, it loses heat to the atmosphere. The falling temperature increases the density of the water so that it sinks and drifts south, pulling warmer surface water north. This phenomenon is called the thermohaline circulation and is the main reason why the waters around the Faroe Islands are warmer than anywhere else at the same latitude in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The other reason is the large atmospheric heat transport carried by the westerlies under the atmospheric jet stream. The Faroese area is therefore also popularly referred to as a large ‘climate oasis’.

Research suggests that the thermohaline circulation was significantly weakened during the ice ages, and it is believed that this weakening contributed to the formation of the cold periods in the north. In connection with climate change, where rising temperatures lead to less cooling, concern has been voiced about whether a corresponding weakening of the thermohaline circulation can be expected in the future. Over the past 25 years, regular measurements have been made of the inflow of Atlantic water to the Faroe Islands, but they have yet to demonstrate any weakening.





The oceanic polar front


In addition to being part of the thermohaline circulation, the Gulf Stream is also part of the subtropical gyre, which is a large, warm, rotating ocean current or eddy that, driven by wind and the Coriolis force, slowly rotates clockwise. To the north, the subtropical gyre adjoins the southern boundary of the subpolar gyre, which is a cold eddy that rotates counterclockwise. On the dividing line between the two oppositely rotating ocean currents runs the oceanic polar front, which controls the direction of the North Atlantic Current.

Although the Gulf Stream moves at a fairly uniform speed, it moves quite a bit in a northern and southern direction, especially in the area where it moves away from the American continental shelf. This affects the course of the oceanic polar front along the western side of the North Atlantic. Where the North Atlantic Current approaches the Faroe Islands, a varying but relatively large part of the current breaks off and continues in between the Rockall rock and the Hebrides. This current affects the course of the oceanic polar front along the eastern side of the North Atlantic.

Both the prevailing wind and the size and strength of the subpolar gyre are closely linked to the oceanic polar front in the west and the east. During periods when the subpolar gyre is large and powerful, vast volumes of cold arctic water will be led between Rockall and the Hebrides. This makes the sea around the Faroe Islands colder, which, in turn, causes the air temperature on land to drop.

At a submarine ridge between Scotland and Iceland, the warm, salty Atlantic water meets the cold and less salty water masses from the north. This is mainly the East Iceland Current, which is a branch of the large south-going and ice-filled East Greenland Current. To emphasise the importance of the warm Atlantic ocean currents, try imagining that the part of the North Atlantic Current that moves north of the Faroe Islands (the Faroe Current) disappeared. The cold East Iceland Current would then surround the plateau on which the Faroe Islands lie, and the climate would become arctic.

A diverging wind field in the area south of Greenland and Iceland causes the surface water of the sea to spread in a fan shape. To replace the water that is pushed out to the sides, cold water rises from the deep parts of the subpolar gyre. In winter, the surface water in the Labrador Sea and the Irminger Sea undergoes significant cooling due to cold, dry winds blowing from the North American continent. Since cold water is heavier than warm water, the cooled surface water will sink at the same time as it pushes a corresponding volume of water up from the depths. Both processes cause nutrient-rich bottom water to flow up towards the surface; a phenomenon called ‘upwelling’.

The upwelling bottom water means that the sea around the Faroe Islands is very nutrient-rich and therefore rich in plankton, which is the foundation of a large food web. The plankton serves as nutrition for large amounts of crustaceans and other zooplankton, which are eaten by small fish, which in turn are preyed on by larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals such as seals and whales.





The atmospheric polar front


While the oceanic polar front follows the boundary between cold and warm water, the atmospheric polar front, or simply the polar front, moves in the boundary region where the cold polar air from the north meets warmer air from the south. It is in this zone that the migrating Atlantic low pressure systems which impact the weather are formed.

The low pressure systems typically develop in the zone between the warm, humid air, especially over the Gulf Stream and the often counterflowing, cooler, heavier and drier sea air. On either side of the polar front, small differences in the wind fields cause the front to meander, forming a front system. The opposite wind directions will, in one direction, pump warm, humid air up above the cold air, so that a warm front develops and, in the opposite direction, push cold polar air under the warm and lighter air to form a cold front. A warm sector is developed between the warm front and the cold front. In the area where the warm fronts and the cold fronts meet, low pressure systems develop rapidly and migrate mainly to the east and northeast with the overlying jet stream. The jet stream over the North Atlantic is a high-altitude system of mainly easterly winds, which at a height of approx. 10 km and at speeds of up to 500 km/h winds its way between the tropospheric and stratospheric layers.

The weather in the Faroe Islands largely depends on the passage of low pressure systems past or over the islands, and since the jet stream varies somewhat in both strength and the path it follows, the behaviour and routes of the low pressure systems over the North Atlantic change from year to year. If the low pressure systems pass north of the Faroe Islands, the islands will first be hit by a warm front, which can result in an extended period of rain. This is followed by a cold front with increased wind force and heavier showers, which may occasionally include hail and thunder. In the period between the warm front and the cold front, there will typically be light rain or fog, although the warm sector can also bring spells of good weather with partial clearing skies. If, on the other hand, the low pressure systems pass south of the Faroe Islands, they draw cool air down over the islands. They often also produce strong winds and large amounts of precipitation which can last up to a whole day for just a single low pressure system passage. However, the low pressure systems often also move so centrally across the islands that these typical features and effects are mixed together.

If the jet stream forms a U-shaped arc just west of the Faroe Islands, the low pressure systems intensify and are carried across the islands from the north. This sends very steep and energetic fronts over land, which can result in the very violent winter storms that have several times caused considerable destruction in and around the Faroe Islands.

Weather conditions on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	The figure shows the highest significant wave height (Hmo) in metres at the Faroe Islands in an average year. BÁRÐUR A. NICLASEN AND KNUD SIMONSEN, 2012 In the log books from Skansin, the old fortress by the port in Tórshavn, you can find recorded weather observations dating as far back as 1782. However, it was not until 1866 that actual weather measurements began in the Faroe Islands on behalf of the Scottish Meteorological Society. Following its foundation in 1872 and until 2009, it was the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) which, in collaboration with local operators, was responsible for the measurements.

At the beginning, temperature, barometric pressure and rainfall were measured, but after World War II, when discarded equipment from the Royal Air Force became available, wind direction, wind speed and humidity have also been measured. Since then, the measurement programme has been extended to include cloud height, visibility and solar radiation. Balloon launch measurements (radio soundings) began just before the war and have continued to this day.

The current radiosonde and measuring station in Hoyvík started in 1993, and for a number of years it served as the headquarters for DMI’s activities in the Faroe Islands. The Løgting (the national parliament) took over the responsibility for the weather service in 2009 and since then, the Faroese fisheries inspection and rescue service Vørn has been in charge of the local measurement programme. In 2020, measuring stations were located in the lighthouses at Mykineshólmur, Borðan and Akraberg as well as in Kirkja, Eiði and Tórshavn.

In addition to a number of shortterm measurement projects carried out by various operators, the road administration, Landsverk, has since 1987 established a tight network of measuring stations, which are used to monitor both the conditions on the islands’ highways and the weather conditions, water levels and sea temperature in selected ports. Since 1979, Landsverk has, in collaboration with Vørn, also carried out regular wave measurements around the islands.





The weather in numbers


The climate in an area is often described by a climate normal, which is based on average weather measurements over a period of typically 30 years. For instance, the latest climate normal for Tórshavn is based on measurements from the period 1991‑2020. The measuring station in Tórshavn lies 55 m above sea level and has during the period recorded an annual mean temperature of 6.8°C, a total annual precipitation of 1,320 mm and an average number of sunshine hours of 869. In addition, there are 35 snow days on average per year.

However, the numbers for Tórshavn should only be considered as representative of the rest of the Faroe Islands to some degree, as the climate can differ considerably locally. Thus, Tórshavn often experiences fog in late summer, which results in a decrease in the number of sunshine hours at this time of the year. Rainfall also varies greatly, with the coastal areas typically getting approx. 1,000 mm per year, while rainfall in the central parts of the Faroe Islands can reach 4,000 mm per year. In addition, the temperature drops by approx. 0.65°C for every 100 m you move above sea level. This means that while the lowlying parts of the Faroe Islands have a temperate climate, high-lying areas have an arctic climate.

There is also great local variation in the wind, and, depending on the location of the measuring stations, they have measured annual mean wind speeds of between 4 and 10 m/s. The Faroe Islands are occasionally hit by very strong winds. During the infamous Christmas hurricane in 1988, an average wind speed of 59 m/s was measured at the high-lying Norðadalsskarð mountain pass over a period of ten minutes. In comparison, hurricanes have an average wind speed of at least 32.6 m/s.





Local weather


There are several explanations for the local climatic differences. The wind is affected by, e.g., the mountains, although their importance and impact are often so complex that it cannot be predicted by existing operational weather models. Somewhat simplistically, however, you can say that the mountains provide shelter from the wind when the wind speed is low to moderate. If, on the other hand, the wind speeds become extreme, the same mountains can lead to the formation of intense local turbulence. This can amplify the wind gusts to such an extent that they cause greater damage than if the wind had come from other directions.

Warm air can contain more water than cold air, and it is therefore the temperature that determines the dew point, i.e. the amount of water the air can contain before droplets start to form. Since the Faroe Islands lie between ocean currents, which are often warmer than the overlying air masses, the air over the islands is often close to the dew point. This explains why it is so often rainy and cloudy on the islands and why only small local changes are needed before clouds gather or fog forms in exposed places. For example, the mountains can be shrouded in fog within minutes, just as you can often escape the recurring summer fog in Tórshavn after just a 20-minute drive away from the area.

Like the wind, precipitation is also affected by the mountains. When the humid air moves over the islands, it is lifted up over the mountains and cooled. This results in increased precipitation in the mountains, but also means that the air dries out a little. On the downwind side of the mountains, the weather conditions will therefore often be better; at best with clear weather and higher temperatures. A popular local rule of thumb also says that if you want better weather, you must move as far as possible in the direction of the wind.





Conditions at sea


The Faroe Islands lie more or less in the middle of the path of the migrating North Atlantic low pressure. This leads to strong wave activity, and the local wave climate is among the most challenging in the world. In general, the west side of the islands is most exposed to wave activity, while the east side is more sheltered.

The difference between high and low tide is quite modest. Due to the layout of the islands, however, narrowings occur, which over short distances can cause such massive tidal differences that the tidal currents in certain places become so strong that they become a challenge to vessels with moderate engine power. Particularly dangerous situations can occur where strong tidal currents move against the direction of the waves. The waves can then develop into breaking waves, which roll over the ships and, at worst, can capsize mainly small vessels.

Akraberg

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Akraberg is the southernmost part of the Faroe Islands. A lighthouse and housing for the lighthouse staff were built here in 1909. Today, the lighthouse in Akraberg, like all others on the Faroe Islands, is remotely operated. The staff housing has been sold to private owners. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 Akraberg is the southernmost part of the Faroe Islands. This exposed place with a lot of surf is presumed to have been inhabited by Frisians from around 1040 until the plague wiped them out. There are many legends about the Frisians in Akraberg, who were pagan long after the Faroe Islands had become Christian. On the east-facing, steep slope by the lighthouse, there is an area with low parallel ridges which may once have been part of the Frisian settlement.

In 1909, the Vitin á Akrabergi lighthouse under the State Lighthouse and Buoy Service was inaugurated, and modern homes were built for the lighthouse keeper and his assistants and family. In 1988, the last lighthouse keeper family moved out, and the homes were sold and are now used as holiday homes.

A weather station and a mediumwave transmitter with associated buildings are located in the village. Traces are also seen of the British occupation during World War II. Today, Akraberg is a popular excursion spot for tourists. In clear weather, it is possible to see the southernmost skerries, Flesjarnar and Sumbiarhólmur, located about 6 km south of Akraberg.

	 	Kollafjørður is a typical Faroese fjord where the Faroe Islands’ new research vessel, Jákup Sverri, is on regular fjord expeditions. The fjord expeditions also cover Sundalagið and Skálafjørður, which are the largest fjords in the Faroe Islands.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 Nowhere in the Faroe Islands is the coast more than 5 km away, and the significance of the surrounding ocean to the climate, nature and business sector is enormous. As much as 99.5 % of the Faroese area is sea, which corresponds to almost three times the Danish sea area. The large sea area stretches from the warm Atlantic Ocean in the southwest to the cold Norwegian Sea in the north and comprises deeply incised fjords along the coast and open ocean with depths that can reach several thousand meters.

To the north, the Faroese sea area borders on the Icelandic and Norwegian sea area, while it adjoins British waters to the south. In 2021, the delimitation of the sea area to the southwest had not yet been clarified and was awaiting a decision in the UN.





Bottom topography


The Faroe Islands are located on the Greenland-Scotland Ridge, which is a submarine ridge that stretches from Greenland to Scotland. The ridge separates the North Atlantic from the Nordic seas to the north and plays a crucial role in the circulation of the water masses in the area. The part of the ridge that is located between Iceland and the Faroe Islands is called the Iceland-Faroe Ridge. In this section, large parts of the ridge are shallower than 500 m, although the ridge gradually deepens towards the Faroe Islands until it reaches the plateau on which the islands are located.

The plateau itself is often defined as an area where the bottom depth does not exceed 200 m. The southern tip of the plateau is relatively long and narrow and partly marks the transition between the Faroe-Shetland Channel to the southeast and the Faroe Bank Channel to the southwest. West of the plateau are three large banks, of which the Faroe Bank is both the largest and the one closest to the Faroe Islands, followed by Bill Baileys Bank and Lousy Bank. From Faroe Bank, the submarine ridge continues as the Wyville Thomson Ridge onto the Scottish plateau.

Apart from the part facing the Iceland-Faroe Ridge, the entire Faroese plateau is surrounded by deep water. In the Faroe-Shetland Channel, bottom depths reach more than 1,000 m, while the Faroe Bank Channel, with a sill depth of 840 m, is the deepest passage across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge.





The open ocean areas


The open ocean around the Faroe Islands is characterised by the large water masses that come from the southwest as warm Atlantic water and from the northeast as cold Arctic water, respectively. The flows of the two water masses are part of the thermohaline circulation, which plays a significant role in the Faroese climate, just as they are decisive for the currents, the temperature and the salinity of the surface and deep water in the open ocean.

The density of water depends on both temperature and salinity, which means that warm water with low salinity is light, while cold water with high salinity is heavy. The warm Atlantic water moved north by the North Atlantic Current towards the Faroe Islands is therefore surface water. The current bifurcates and crosses the Iceland-Faroe Ridge and then merges into the Faroe Current north of the Faroe Islands. After this, the current bifurcates again, with one branch continuing east towards Norway, while the other turns southwest into the Faroe-Shetland Channel. The branch that flows into the Faroe-Shetland Channel meets a branch of Atlantic water from the west and southwest. They join and follow each other northeast past the Shetland Islands. The many currents are all branches of the North Atlantic Current, and together they account for the surface water in almost all Faroese waters being warm Atlantic water.

As the Atlantic water moves further and further north, it cools and becomes cold arctic water. At the same time, it mixes with fresh water and less salty seawater, which means that part of the Arctic water remains so light that it is able to stay in the upper water layers. The Arctic surface water moves south, but is blocked north of the Faroe Islands by warm Atlantic water.

However, most of the Arctic water retains most of its salinity and, as it also cools rapidly, it sinks to great depths. The large basins north of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge are therefore filled with cold arctic water. Via the deep channels, the arctic deep water crosses the submarine ridge and flows to the southwest. Although the largest flow occurs via the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland, around a third of the water flows through the Faroe-Shetland Channel and on through the Faroe Bank Channel. A smaller part also manages to flow over the Iceland-Faroe Ridge and the Wyville Thomson Ridge, respectively.

When the Arctic deep water leaves the channel, it joins Atlantic water at a depth of 500‑1,000 m. At such great depths, the Atlantic water is cooler than at the surface, but it is still significantly warmer than the cold Arctic deep water, and the mixing of the two water masses is intense. A corresponding mixing occurs with the Arctic deep water from the Denmark Strait, and together these mixed water masses are called North Atlantic Deep Water. The North Atlantic Deep Water covers large parts of the deep Atlantic where it transports mainly oxygen (O2) but also carbon dioxide (CO2) from the North Atlantic to the southern part of the Atlantic and from here on to the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.





The plateau area


The Faroese plateau covers an area of about 20,000 km2 and has an average depth of 100 m. To the north, the plateau is relatively flat, but there are also several banks, which are bounded by deeper channels, especially to the east. Currents on the plateau are characterised by strong tides, which in places can reach speeds of more than 1 m/s. The tidal waves from the Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea meet here and form a so-called amphidromic point around which they move. At the amphidromic point, there is virtually no tidal amplitude. The movements of the tidal waves and the location of the amphidromic point mean that the difference between high and low tide is greatest to the west and becomes smaller and smaller to the east, while gradually delaying the times of ebb and flood at the same time. At Tórshavn, for example, the tidal amplitude is very small. The delay and the variation in the size of the tide create very strong tidal currents between the islands, just as they contribute to the water on the plateau circulating clockwise.

The strong tidal currents mix the water above the plateau (shelf water), and in the shallow parts the water is mixed from bottom to top all year round. In winter, the shallow areas cool more than the surrounding waters, so that at a depth of around 100 m, a front forms between the cool shelf water and the warm Atlantic water. The front is very dynamic, and in May-June it becomes more layered and takes the form of a typical tidal front. In spring, the entire front formation is largely controlled by the atmospheric conditions and it may therefore vary greatly from one year to the next. If the conditions are favourable, large algal blooms can occur in the mixed shelf water early in the year and later also in the front area. In some years, however, the optimum conditions are not present and algal blooms are modest.

The temperature of the shelf water changes with the seasons. The lowest temperatures are typically 6‑7°C from the end of February to March, while the highest temperatures are seen in August and September at 10‑11°C. The temperature is partly determined by the atmosphere, but also by warm and cold periods in the Atlantic water. At the end of the 1910s as well as in the mid-1990s, the Atlantic water was relatively cold, while for the past 15 years it has been in a fairly stable warm period.





The fjords


The Faroe Islands have a very long coast with long, incised fjords, which are connected to the ocean through narrow mouths. Several of the fjords are sill fjords, where one or more sills divide the individual fjord into deeper basins, and where the shallowest sill is typically at the mouth. At the bottom of the fjord and along the sides, there is an inflow of fresh water from rivers.

Since the tidal impact on the fjords is usually low, the fresh water from the rivers immediately mixes with the seawater and becomes brackish. Due to its lower salinity, the brackish water is lighter than seawater and settles as a 10‑20 m layer at the surface. The brackish water flows towards the fjord mouth, and to compensate for the outflowing, brackish surface water, salty shelf water flows into the fjord under the brackish water.

In summer, the shelf water warms and can therefore become so light that it does not sink to the bottom of the fjords. In the deeper basins of the sill fjords, this can mean that the bottom water is not replaced, causing oxygen depletion. It occurs every year in Skálafjørður, which is the longest and deepest fjord in the Faroe Islands. The period of oxygen depletion can last several months, but ends when temperatures drop in autumn and cool shelf water starts bringing oxygen to the bottom water again.





Faroe Bank Channel


West of the Faroe Islands, between the Faroe Bank and the Faroese plateau, is the Faroe Bank Channel, which together with the Denmark Strait is responsible for the vast majority of the cold deep water transported from the Norwegian Sea and on into the world’s oceans. Both cut across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge, and with a sill depth of 840 m, the Faroe Bank Channel is the deepest of the two.

However, the Faroe Bank Channel is narrow, and in the deep part at the sill, it is only 10 km wide. The cold Arctic deep water, which flows through the deepest 200‑300 m of the channel, therefore reaches a speed of approx. 1 m/s. This means that the volumes of water that pass through the Faroe Bank Channel are enormous. Every second, an average of about 2,000,000–m3 of Arctic deep water flow through the channel, corresponding to about twice the total water transport of all the world’s rivers.





Coastal Macroalgae


Algae is a collective term for several different groups of organisms and comprises representatives from both plants, protists and bacteria. They are often divided into microalgae and macroalgae, where the macroalgae are the larger, multicellular species. Most macroalgae are marine, sessile organisms that grow along the coast in areas where the substrate is stable. Together with the sea grasses, they are also called seaweed. The Faroese rocky coasts have an abundance of macroalgae, and the extensive, lush seaweed forests play an important role in the coastal marine environment, just as they are habitat and breeding ground for a number of fish species and an even greater number of invertebrates.





Growth conditions


Light, concentration of nutrient salts, salinity and temperature are all decisive for the growth and spread of macroalgae. While the salinity in the sea around the Faroe Islands remains fairly stable at around 35‰ all year round, light, sea temperature and the amount of dissolved nutrient salts vary with the seasons. The light intensity determines how deep the macroalgae can grow, just as it determines the growth rate. The same applies to the sea temperature, which fluctuates from around 7°C in winter to 10‑11°C in summer. Since the temperature, day length and light intensity peak in the summer, it is also during this period that macroalgae grow the most.

The concentration of dissolved nutrient salts is also a limiting factor for algae growth and like light and temperature, it is seasonal. Nitrate (NO3-) is usually the nutrient salt that is depleted the fastest and thereby becomes a limiting factor for macroalgae growth. Measurements in the water above the Faroese plateau have shown that the nitrate concentration fluctuates from 2.2 to 10.2 μM in May-September. The fluctuations are linked to the growth of microalgae in spring and summer. Due to their size, the planktonic microalgae are far more efficient at absorbing the dissolved nutrient salts than the macroalgae, and both nitrate and other nutrient salts are therefore quickly bound in the microalgae biomass. In the upper water layers of the fjords, where the density of microalgae is highest, the nitrate can be completely depleted, causing that the concentration to drop to about 0 μM for shorter or longer periods. However, waves and currents also affect nitrate concentration, and measurements in Kaldbaksfjørður have shown that the periods of very low concentration are shortest in the areas where the fjord is most exposed.





The zoning of algae populations


Each of the many species of macroalgae makes specific demands on the environment in which they grow, and they are therefore distributed in different habitats, each characterised by certain environmental factors such as degree of drying, temperature, light intensity, currents, etc. The macroalgae can be found somewhere above the intertidal zone to a depth of more than 30 m where they are distributed according to depth and exposure, creating a more or less clear zoning.

When the waves crash over the most exposed coasts, the seawater sprays high up against the rocks, which means that certain macroalgae are able to grow up to 20 m above the intertidal zone. In the fjords and on the more sheltered coasts, on the other hand, the boundary for the upper distribution of the algae is to a greater extent determined by the tide. Here, the intertidal zone is characterised by brown algae such as rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) and bladder wrack (Fucus vesiculosus), both of which form floating bladders, which give them buoyancy. Rockweed in particular is an indicator of sheltered coasts and is completely absent where the coast is exposed. Bladder wrack tolerates a higher degree of exposure, although it only appears sporadically on exposed coasts and typically grows in rock crevices where it is protected from the surf. On the exposed coasts, intertidal zones are instead characterised by various red algae such as coral weed (Corallina officinalis), false Irish moss (Mastocarpus stellatus), dulse (Palmaria palmata) and purple laver (Porphyra umbilicalis) as well as the brown algae thongweed (Himanthalia elongata). Around the low water line, you can also find the brown algae winged kelp (Alaria esculenta).

Below the low water line, in the perpetually water-covered zone, species that do not tolerate drying start to appear. Conditions are especially good for macroalgae on the exposed coasts. Here, the current and the waves have removed the sediments, leaving stable substrates onto which the macroalgae can attach. The large species of kelp now start to appear; first oarweed (Laminaria digitata) and, slightly deeper, cuvie (Laminaria hyperborea), which in this zone form large, extensive kelp forests. At a depth of 20 m, the kelp forests on the exposed coasts begin to thin out. When you reach a depth of 30 m, cuvie only appears in small numbers and at these depths the dwindling light is probably a limiting factor for the spread of algae.

On the sheltered coasts, the macroalgae are only found at a depth of a few metres. The limiting factor is often the substrate, which, due to the modest water movement, forms a thick layer of very fine mud, to which algae cannot attach. Large brown algae such as sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima), oarweed and cuvie dominate the upper meters and are distributed in the stated order. Contrary to the exposed coasts, cuvie does not manage to form large kelp forests, and the individual kelp plants are generally small.





A diversity of macroalgae


As part of the comprehensive Biofar project, the diversity of macroalgae in the Faroe Islands was thoroughly studied over a period from July 1994 to August 2000. Phycologists Ruth Nielsen and Karl Gunnarsson beaded the study, where macroalgae were collected from 265 locations spread across the islands. The study was able to document a total of 260 different species of macroalgae distributed into 113 species of red algae, 83 species of brown algae and 64 species of green algae. Of these, 41 species were not previously known from the Faroe Islands.

In connection with the study, focus was mainly aimed at coralline red algae and laver. Subsequently, work on particularly laver was continued, leading to the discovery of an entirely new species, which was officially described in 2012. The species was named Pyropia njordii after Njord (Njørður), who in Norse mythology was the god of, among other things, the sea. In addition to the Faroe Islands, the species is also known from Iceland, Greenland, New England in the USA and Nova Scotia in Canada, but the type specimen, which defines the new species, was collected in 2006 at Tjaldavík in Trongisvágsfjørður on Suðuroy.

The work carried out in connection with the Biofar project makes it possible to record changes in the Faroe Islands’ macroalgae population. So far, no changes have been recorded, but it is expected that due to rising sea temperatures caused by global climate change, new species of macroalgae will eventually immigrate from the south.





Cultivation of macroalgae


Kelp forest at low tide. Cuvie creates optimum conditions for other species to thrive in the kelp forest, and dulse often grows on the stem of the cuvie.

AGNES MOLS MORTENSEN, 2020 Although Asia has a long tradition of cultivating and eating macroalgae, macroalgae cultivation in Northern Europe is in its infancy. However, the Faroe Islands have already had several years of experience with the cultivation of winged kelp (Alaria esculenta) and sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima), and actual commercial exploitation is gradually being established around the two species. Cultivation trials have also been carried out with cuvie (Laminaria hyperborea), oarweed (Laminaria digitata) and dulse (Palmaria palmata), but none of these are yet cultivated on a commercial scale.

In 2005, the Nordic initiative Nordic Seaweed Project was behind the first cultivation trials in the Faroe Islands. Attempts were first made at cultivating winged kelp, which proved to have great potential. Subsequently, Fiskaaling (Aquaculture Research Station) has started research in macroalgae and considers the cultivation of macroalgae as a new aquaculture in the Faroe Islands.

Today, two companies have been established in the Faroe Islands with macroalgae cultivation as their main activity: TARI – Faroe Seaweed and Ocean Rainforest. The first three licences for macroalgae cultivation were issued by the Faroese authorities in July 2020. Thus, Ocean Rainforest was given licence to cultivate sugar kelp in Funningsfjørður, while TARI – Faroe Seaweed was given licence to cultivate winged kelp, oarweed, sugar kelp, dulse and umbilical purple laver in Kaldbaksfjørður. In addition, TARI – Faroe Seaweed was given permission to establish a landbased facility in Fámjin. Here, the propagation materials used in the further cultivation process are isolated, and the ropes on which the macroalgae grow are seeded.

The macroalgae produced in the Faroe Islands are sold both for human consumption and as finished and ingredient products. Some are also sold as animal feed. Among the many products are, for example, Ocean Wings, which is based on locally grown winged kelp.





Cuvie – the largest macroalgae in the Faroe Islands


With a total length of almost 3 m, curvie (Laminaria hyperborea) is the largest macroalgae in the sea around the Faroe Islands, where it is the supporting, structural element in the large, coastal kelp forests. Cuvie belongs to the brown algae and, together with sugar kelp and oarweed, is called kelp.

Like the other species of kelp, cuvie has a strong holdfast (haptera), a long and strong stem with a rough surface and a thick and leathery leaf plate, which is divided into numerous fingerlike sections. Both the holdfast and the stem are perennial, while the leaf plate withers and must be formed anew every year. In the late winter months, you can thus see the new leaf growing from the transition between the stem and the old leaf. The stem itself can be up to 2.3 m long, and as with trees, it is possible to determine the age of an individual of cuvie by making a cut at the bottom through the stem and counting the growth rings. The oldest cuvie found in the Faroe Islands was 13 years old.

A rich wildlife and algal life is attached to the cuvie’s stem and holdfast. At low tide, for example, you can clearly see the red algae dulse (Palmaria palmata) growing on the upper part of the cuvie stem. Dulse is a common red algae in the Faroe Islands where it grows from the intertidal zone out to approx. 15 m depth. It is also a popular edible algae.





Macroalgae in salmon farming


Seaweed shelter, called AkvaNest, give the cleaning fish a natural habitat in salmon farming facilities. TARI has developed AkvaNest in collaboration with the Faroese salmon industry, and the results look promising.

AGNES MOLS MORTENSEN, 2019 Salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) constitutes a major challenge in salmon farming in the Faroe Islands. The small crustacean lives as a parasite on the salmon where it feeds on the fish’s mucus, skin and blood.

For years, salmon farmers have used lumpsuckers (Cyclopterus lumpus) to get rid of the salmon lice. The lumpsuckers are released into the farms together with the salmon, where they serve as effective lice eaters. Unfortunately, the lumpsuckers do not thrive in the farms. However, among the many attempts to improve the conditions for the important ‘cleaning fish’, macroalgae have proved to be a possible solution. Unlike the free-swimming salmon, lumpsuckers need a substrate to sit on and hide in, and since they are found naturally in seaweed forests, many salmon farms have tried introducing plastic shelters that are meant to imitate kelp.

As an alternative to the plastic shelters, TARI – Faroe Seaweed, together with the salmon industry, has developed a more natural seaweed shelter for the lumpsuckers. Various macroalgae are grown on the seaweed shelters, so that they function as a kind of floating kelp forests, where the lumpsuckers can hide. The idea is that the natural seaweed shelter become a sustainable way of creating better living conditions for the lumpsuckers.

Hvannhagi

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The nature in Hvannhagi with the small lake Hvannvatn is considered by many to be one of the most special traits of the Faroe Islands. The area has become a popular holiday destination for both Faroese and visitors. In the background, the islands of Lítla Dímun and Stóra Dímun can just be seen.

KALLERNA/WIKIMEDIA/CREATIVE COMMONS, 2019 One of the most beautiful places in the Faroe Islands is Hvannhagi with the lake Hvannavatn. Originally, the entire area was a coherent unit, but then two sisters were to inherit the area. One was married to a man from Trongisvágur, and the other to a man from Froðba. The sisters agreed to share the inheritance, but they could not agree on where to divide the area. During the dispute, a large rockslide occurred from the mountain at Gráhamar, and the place in which the material ended is called Gráurð. This divided Hvannhagi into two equal parts, and Gráurð has since been the border between the part belonging to Trongisvágur and the part belonging to Froðba. Lake Hvannavatn came to belong to Trongisvágur.

Landscapes and coasts on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Off the Kollurin peninsula at Eiði, two cliffs rise out into the sea. That is Risin and Kellingin (The Giant and the Witch). According to the legend, the two trolls tried to move the Faroe Islands to Iceland, but their venture failed because when the sun rose, they were turned into stone.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2009 The landscape and the surrounding seabed reflect the volcanic activity, which, some 61 million years ago, marked the starting point of the formation of the Faroese land area as well as the subsequent extended period of erosion in a climate that gradually became cooler. The erosion of the land area accelerated mainly within the last 2‑3 million years when recurring ice ages and interglacials transformed what remained of the original extensive basalt plain into the 18 small steep islands that make up the Faroe Islands today.

The islands are separated by narrow sounds, which predominantly have a northwest-southeast orientation. While the smallest islands and islets merely jut out of the sea like giant rocks, the larger islands have such vast land masses that more varied landscapes have emerged with inlets, fjords, mountains and valleys as well as local vertical cliffs facing the sea. The landscapes often continue into the sea where they form submarine valleys and ridges as well as a multitude of channels.





The landscapes and their geology


The valleys and fjords are undoubtedly among the Faroe Islands’ most characteristic landscapes. The largest valleys often begin as concave cirque valleys, which over their course turn into elongated valleys with steep mountain sides and wide valley bottoms. Along the coast, the valleys continue as fjords and sounds.

The grassy mountain sides are characterised by bare elongated basaltic lava flows that stretch through the landscape in long, almost horizontal lines. The basaltic lava flows are the remains of the original surface of basaltic lava, which, layer by layer, has built up the Faroe Islands, and which, some 55 million years ago, formed a large, flat basalt plain. Over time, especially during the ice ages, ice, water and wind have eroded down through the old volcanic plain, creating the steep, terraced landscapes that offer a glimpse into the original basalt plain and reveal snippets of the islands’ early history.





The characteristic landscapes


Trælanípa (Slave Mountain) is a perpendicular cliff that rises 142 meters from the sea. It is said that it got its name from the Viking Age, when disobedient slaves were pushed off the mountain.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 Of the six geological formations, mainly three form regional landscapes: The Beinisvørð Formation, the Malinstindur Formation and the Enni Formation.

In the westernmost part of the country, particularly on Suðuroy and Mykines, it is the old basalt lava flows of the Beinisvørð Formation that forms the surface. These basalt lava flows were earlier called the lower basalt sequence. The terraced landscapes of the Beinisvørð Formation, which alternate between approx. 20 m thick basalt lava flows and approx. 1 m thick layers of reddish sediments, are clearly seen in the mountainside above Drelnes on Suðuroy.

The characteristic landscapes in the northern part of Suðuroy, Vágar, Streymoy and Eysturoy are made up of the Malinstindur Formation, which forms more coherent landscapes with a less distinct terraced formation. The formation is characterised by many thin basalt lava flows and only few intermediate sediment layers. In addition, porous zones in the basalt are filled with secondary minerals such as zeolites or quartz minerals. These basalt lava flows were earlier called the middle basalt sequence and can be seen in the mountain area around Vestmanna in the northern part of Streymoy where the mountains have a more rounded shape and no or only modest terraced formation.

On large parts of Norðoyggjar (the Northern Islands) and the southern parts of Eysturoy as well as on Streymoy, Nólsoy, Sandoy and Skúvoy, the landscapes are formed by the Enni Formation. The basaltic lava flows, which mark each of the volcanic eruptions that created the formation, are separated by relatively thick, reddish sediment layers and now appear as terraced mountain slopes that alternate between bare, almost horizontal basaltic lava flows and intermediate slopes covered with vegetation. However, the terraces are not as large as in the Beinisvørð Formation on Suðuroy.





Gorges and giant fences


Long gorges can be found everywhere. These gorges, called ‘gjógv’ in Faroese, are eroded fissures and basaltic dikes that extend into the original basalt plain. In some cases, the fissure zones have eroded into deep gorges, where invasion of magma has created transverse basalt columns at the bottom. Frammi við Gjónna at Leynavatn and Gøtugjógv on Eysturoy are typical examples of deep gorges that have formed from the erosion of basaltic dikes.

The intruding magma has created basaltic dikes, which have become more resistant than the surrounding basalt lava flows. In such cases, weathering of the surrounding material can cause the basalt dike to remain as a ridge with horizontal columnar basalts. These ridges are often called ‘jatnagarður’ as they resemble giant fences. An excellent example of a giant fence can be seen at Jatnagarðar on Vágar.





Sloping basalt lava flows


As volcanic activity died out and the erosion of the vast plateau accelerated, the basalt layers began to slope. Today, they typically have an eastern dip of about 2‑4° as can be seen along the fjord Kaldbaksfjørður. Here, it is also possible to follow the boundary between the Malinstindur Formation and the Enni Formation. The boundary is approx. 180 m up in the innermost part of the fjord, while it is at sea level 5 km further out in the fjord.





The remains of the original basalt plain


Coastal eroded landscapes at Ásmundarstakkur on Suðuroy’s west side. The rugged coast testifies to both the current constant wave erosion of the coastal landscapes and how the ice during the still recurring ice ages has cut down through the basalt plain and transformed it into the 18 islands that today make up the Faroe Islands.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 Before the beginning of the ice ages 2.6 million years ago, the Faroe Islands were probably one large, more coherent land area with flatter and more open landscapes, while the current long sounds and fjords would have been narrow river valleys. However, as erosion ate away through the basalt plain the original landscape disappeared, and the closest you can get to the old plain landscape today are the flat tops of the islands’ highest mountains.

The highest mountain is the 880 m high Slættaratindur on the northern part of Eysturoy. It is characterised by steep mountain sides, but if you follow the footpath to the top, a bare and windswept plain is revealed covering an area of just under 1,000 m2. Other mountains have even larger flat tops. Among them is the 767 m high Skælingsfjall on Streymoy, whose top forms an approx. 30,000 m2 large plain of old preglacial landscape.





Ice Age landscapes


Through the numerous ice ages over the past 2.6 million years, the Faroe Islands have probably been partially covered by ice between 20 and 30 times. During the last Ice Age, the Weichsel, the ice reached its maximum thickness of approx. 750 m above sea level around Reyðafelstindur in the middle of Eysturoy, which meant that the highest mountain peaks extended above the ice masses as ice-free nunataks. In the shallow part of the Sundalagið sound, where Eysturoy and Streymoy are today linked by a bridge, the ice was divided so that it moved north in the north and south in the south.

The ice slid out through depressions, which were deepened over time into deep, U-shaped valleys with wide bottoms and steep valley sides. As the ice approached the former coastline, the thickness of the ice decreased, so that the higher areas remained ice-free, including the summit of Eiðiskollur on Eysturoy and the highest parts of Nólsoy. On their way across the landscape, the glaciers deepened several large lakes such as Sørvágsvatn (Leitisvatn) and Fjallavatn on Vágar.

In the areas where the landscape was covered in ice, the wear of the ice has rounded the rocks, and you will also find indicator boulders that were transported with the ice. If the rock surfaces have been exposed recently and therefore have not disintegrated, you can often also see glacial scratches, which show the direction of the ice’s movement. These signs reveal that the ice moved out from the Faroe Islands in all directions, which shows that the islands formed an independent glaciation area, which was separated from the ice sheets over Scandinavia, Iceland and Scotland, respectively.

Since many outer coastal landscapes have been heavily eroded by the sea, the valley landscapes were probably much greater during the Ice Age. Examples of such coastal eroded Ice Age landscapes can be seen at Ásmundarstakkur west of Sandvík on Suðuroy and at Tindhólmur west of Sørvágur.





Changes in sea level


Studies of the seabed in the Skálafjørður fjord have shown that, after the last Ice Age, the sea level was so low that the submarine ridge, Saltnesgrynnan, west of Toftir was dry land and that the fjord was a freshwater lake. However, with the melting of the huge ice caps in, for instance, North America, the sea level gradually began to rise, and 7,300 years ago, salty seawater passed over Saltnesgrynnan, transforming the freshwater lake into a fjord.

Despite the rising sea level, the sea level has never been as high as it is today since the last Ice Age, which is confirmed by the fact that coastal lakes such as Gróthúsvatn on Sandoy and Niðara Vatn at Eiði have never been salt lakes. Contrary to Iceland and Scandinavia, which were pressed down by the ice masses of the Ice Age and up to this day have been characterised by continuous postglacial rebound, the same does not seem to be the case in the Faroe Islands. The most likely explanation is that, during the last Ice Age, the Faroese land area was already so small and eroded that the ice masses remained small and light and therefore were not able to press the land down.

If the area was not pressed down by the ice and thus has had no postglacial rebound, the Faroe Islands must have been affected only by the changes in the sea level of the oceans, which at the end of the last Ice Age was about 130 m lower than today. If the current coastline is moved out to a depth of 130 m, it becomes clear that the Faroe Islands were not an archipelago, but an almost coherent, glaciated land area during the last Ice Age. Fjords and sound formed the lowest parts of the Ice Age landscape, and it was here that small glaciers gathered into larger ones on their way to the former coast. Today’s fjords and sounds should therefore be regarded as flooded valleys, and the sandy and gravelled plains that the meltwater created in front of the glaciers are today below sea level.

An example of a flooded valley is the Kaldbaksfjørður fjord in southeastern Streymoy. During the last Ice Age, Kaldbaksfjørður was a valley with a glacier that reached all the way to the shoulder of the valley. From Kaldbaksbotnur at the bottom of the valley, the glacier moved down through the valley and merged with an even larger glacier in the wide valley which today forms the sound between Streymoy and Eysturoy. The glacier, which was probably the largest in the Faroe Islands during the last Ice Age, continued into the then dry Nólsoyfjørður fjord. From here, part of the ice masses moved south through the fjord, while the rest continued across the low northern part of Nólsoy towards the then coastline, which around 22,000 years ago laid east of Nólsoy.

Although it must be assumed that the Faroe Islands have been through the same number of ice ages and interglacials as the rest of the North Atlantic area, sediments from these periods are rare. An exception is the coastal hill at Borðoyarvík in Klaksvík, which contains material from both the last Ice Age, the Weichsel, and the penultimate Ice Age, the Saale. Between these two moraine deposits are 115,000-year-old seabed sediments from the Eem interglacial, when the sea level was 5‑6 m higher than today.





The high mountains


Today, the climate is predominantly considered as temperate, and in July and August the average temperature in the coastal, grassy landscapes is around 11°C. If you want to experience an arctic climate, you must therefore go up into the high mountains. The air temperature drops by around 0.65°C for every 100 m above sea level, and at an altitude of around 150 m you encounter the 10°C isotherm. Above the isotherm, the average temperature never rises above 10°C in the hottest months of the year, and it thus marks the boundary where the climate changes from temperate to arctic.

Of the total area, only 31 % lies below the 10°C isotherm and thus in the temperate climate zone, while the remaining 69 % reaches altitudes of over 150 m and must therefore be considered as arctic. In these highaltitude areas, the landscapes are in many places characterised by frost weathering, just as frost-sorted gravel forms polygonal grounds and stone stripes. Modest plant growth and high grazing intensity mean that large mountain areas are partially or completely devoid of vegetation. When there are no plant roots to hold the ground on the steep slopes, the frost together with the abundant rainfall and strong winds lead to soil erosion, which frequently turns into landslides and other geohazards.





Today’s coastal landscapes


Kollafjørður is a typical Faroese fjord where the Faroe Islands’ new research vessel, Jákup Sverri, is on regular fjord expeditions. The fjord expeditions also cover Sundalagið and Skálafjørður, which are the largest fjords in the Faroe Islands.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 The often dramatic coasts offer plenty of opportunities to observe the landscape processes in action. Its location in the middle of the North Atlantic westerly wind belt in combination with numerous low pressure fronts means that the Faroe Islands are often hit by storms with high wind speeds, which create strong surf on the exposed outer coasts. Colloquially, many of these exposed coasts are called brimpláss or surf spots.

Akraberg is the southernmost part of the Faroe Islands. A lighthouse and housing for the lighthouse staff were built here in 1909. Today, the lighthouse in Akraberg, like all others on the Faroe Islands, is remotely operated. The staff housing has been sold to private owners.

ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 The waves’ constant erosion of the relatively strong basalt has shaped the several hundred meter high vertical cliffs that characterise many of the outer coasts. To the west, very high cliffs can be seen on the coasts from Suðuroy to Lítla Dímun, Stóra Dímun, Skúvoy, Sandoy, Hestur, Koltur, Vágar and Mykines, and the steep cliffs of Vestmannabjørgini and Saksunarbjørgini are characteristic of the coast of Streymoy west of Vestmanna and Saksun, respectively. Also, in the north, on the area from Mykines to Vágar, Streymoy, Eysturoy, Kalsoy, Kunoy, Borðoy, Viðoy and Fugloy, high cliffs can be seen along the wave-exposed outer coasts. The Faroe Islands’ highest cliff is the 754 m high Enniberg on Viðoy’s north coast. It is also the second highest coastal cliff in Europe, surpassed only by Hornelen in Norway.

The surf towards the western and northern outer coasts can be so heavy that storm surfaces are formed, which are small coastal platforms that lie just above normal sea level. They are formed by erosion from the heavy surf that can occur when sea levels rise during a low pressure front that is accompanied by a storm. Sea stacks in the form of the flat-topped ‘stakkur’ can often be seen on the storm surfaces, and since the flats are just above sea level, they stand on dry land when the weather is calm, as can be experienced at Mykineshólmur and on the west coast of Hestur. The storm surfaces resemble the raised coasts that can be seen in, for example, Iceland and Norway. However, the fact that the Faroese storm surfaces are located in some of the most energetic surf environments and never in calm waters makes it highly unlikely that the coast should be raised.

In areas where the coasts are sheltered, the slopes continue more evenly into the sea, and the vegetation often stretches right down to the beach. In many places, these coasts also resemble Ice Age landscapes. For example, you can find thin but clear glacial scratches, which show that the coast has remained more or less intact since the last Ice Age, and that wave erosion has been modest.

Nature and environmental management


trap.fo



	 	Common guillemots (Uria aalge) sit close on the steep cliffs of Skúvoy. They choose narrow ledges for their nests into which they lay a single egg. The 8-cm long eggs have a pointed cone-shape, which reduces the risk of it rolling over the ledge; should it move, it will just roll in circles.

HANS ELI SIVERTSEN, 2009 Since the 1960s, the Faroe Islands have experienced rapid development within areas such as infrastructure, occupational distribution, energy consumption and tourism, which has naturally left its mark on the nature and the environment of the islands. According to the Home Rule Act, environment and nature management are Faroese jurisdictions, and it is thus the Faroe Islands that are responsible for the legislation intended to protect nature and regulate activities that may affect or be harmful to the environment. In 2020, nature and environmental management was mainly based on Act of the Faroese Parliament on Environmental Protection from 1988, Act of the Faroese Parliament on the Protection of the Marine Environment from 2005 and Act of the Faroese Parliament on Nature Conservation from 1970.





The Environmental Protection Act


The Act of the Faroese Parliament on Environmental Protection aims to prevent and limit pollution of air, water and soil with solid, liquid and gaseous substances as well as ensure that vibrations and light from all sources stay within acceptable threshold values. The act primarily regulates activities on land, but also covers fish farming in sea farms.

The minister for the environment is the highest authority within the environmental area. Some areas have been transferred to the municipalities, which then serve as local environmental authorities, while other areas are managed by Umhvørvisstovan (the Environment Agency), which is an agency under the minister for the environment. The municipalities environmental responsibility covers collection, reuse and disposal of refuse and waste water and they also supervise small businesses. Environmental approval of companies and facilities that may be the source of significant pollution is, on the other hand, managed by Umhvørvisstovan. Environmental approvals contain conditions that companies must comply with in order to limit pollution. These conditions relate to emissions to the air, discharges to the water and soil, noise, odour, etc. Other conditions include requirements for self-monitoring and reporting.





Sea farming


Today, farming of salmon is one of the Faroe Islands’ biggest businesses, and with an annual production in the years leading up to 2020 of around 100,000 tonnes, salmon production plays a key role in the Faroese economy. However, the discharge of excrement and feed residues from the farms also makes salmon farming a potentially critical source of nutrient loading in fjords and sounds.

In order to maintain a sustainable production and keep the environmental impact to a minimum, it is crucial that organic material does not accumulate under the farms, but is carried away by the current or converted by bacteria and benthic animals. In the environmental approvals for sea farming, special requirements have therefore been imposed on the operation, and both internal inspection and supervision are carried out regularly. As part of the environmental supervision of the farming industry, the environmental authorities require that the condition of the seabed under and near the farms is monitored. If the environmental load becomes unacceptably high, the companies must adapt their operations so that the load falls to an acceptable level. This can for example be done by moving the farms or reducing the number of fish.





Wind turbines


In 2020, diesel power stations accounted for 61.3 % of electricity production, while water and wind turbines accounted for 26.7 % and 11.6 %, respectively. However, the intermunicipal electricity company, SEV, has a goal that all electricity production must come from renewable energy sources by 2030, which will require a significant expansion of renewable energy. Wind turbines will probably play an important part in this respect, and a large number of wind turbines will therefore need to be erected on the islands before 2030.





Environmental monitoring


Regular monitoring is undertaken of both environmentally harmful substances and air quality. Monitoring of environmentally harmful substances has been carried out every year since 1997 and focuses in particular on long-range atmospheric transport of substances, which are covered by international conventions, including mercury and slowly degradable organic substances, the so-called POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants), as well as more recent environmental pollutants.

Part of the monitoring includes analyses of the content of substances harmful to the environment and health in animal species such as longfinned pilot whales, fish and birds that form part of the Faroese diet. These analyses are carried out as part of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP). For certain animal species, the analyses go back a long way, meaning that long time series have been compiled for the levels of pollutants in the Faroe Islands.

Air quality is of great importance to public health, and since 2014, the concentration of particles as well as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and NOX in the air has been measured by a measuring station at a very busy road in Tórshavn and a background measuring station outside the town where there are no noticeable sources of pollution. Since 2018, a measuring station in Kaldbak has also been used, which is close to a large diesel power plant. Monitoring is also part of the contingency in the event of severe air pollution, which can for example occur in connection with volcanic eruptions. During Eyjafjallajökull’s major eruption in Iceland in 2010, the Faroe Islands experienced significant ashfall.

Both the background station and the station at the power plant in Kaldbak have only recorded low concentrations of health-harming substances. In Tórshavn, higher concentrations have been measured, which vary in particular with the time of day and the wind direction. The health-harming substances likely originate mainly from cars.





The Marine Environment Act


The Act of the Faroese Parliament on the Protection of the Marine Environment aims to prevent and reduce the pollution of both the sea and the air with solid, liquid and gaseous substances. It primarily regulates emissions from ships and imposes a number of requirements to prevent and limit pollution. These requirements are largely based on rules from the IMO (International Maritime Organization). For instance, there are rules for waste management on board ships, just as it is forbidden to dispose of certain substances and materials in the sea. All ports must also have reception facilities for the various types of waste that come from the ships. This applies to all types of plastic.

Plastic that ends up in the ocean does not break down naturally, but instead breaks up into smaller pieces that can cause harm if ingested by birds and fish. Over time, the pieces of plastic are reduced to microplastics and nanoplastics, which can be absorbed by smaller and smaller organisms. It is still unknown what consequences the microplastics can have for the wildlife in the sea and for the people who eat, for example, fish and shellfish.

In order to limit air pollution from the ships, rules stipulate which fuels they may use. The rules mainly set limits for the content of sulphur in the oil, which pollutes the air with the harmful sulphur dioxide (SO2). Ships calling at Faroese ports or at anchor less than two nautical miles from shore may only use oil with a maximum sulphur content of 0.1 %. In the past, ships were often the source of oil pollution, especially in connection with the bunkering of oil. Strict rules on bunkering have therefore been made, and both the suppliers and recipients of the oil must follow certain procedures and closely monitor the bunkering. Significant fines are imposed if oil pollution is due to a lack of monitoring or if the equipment used is not in proper condition. In order to prevent invasive alien species or pathogenic organisms from spreading from one sea area to another, ships that carry ballast water and arrive from another country or sea area are not allowed to discharge the ballast water without treating or cleaning it first.





The Nature Conservation Act


The Act of the Faroese Parliament on Nature Conservation defines conservation zones that cover large parts of the Faroese land area. Construction and major interventions in nature or the landscape in the outfield as well as certain places in the infield near beaches, lakes, streams and plantations thus require dispensation from the conservation authorities. In cases of dispensation for the construction of buildings in the protected zones, emphasis is placed on the buildings’ appearance and location in the landscape. The Nature Conservation Act is managed by a national conservation board and by several local conservation boards.

The act also allows certain areas to be protected either to protect special landscapes or vulnerable animal and plant species. Today, there are three protected areas: an area by the lake Leynavatn on Streymoy, an area around the lake Fjallavatn on Vágar and Mølheyggjar on Sandoy. Mølheyggjar on Sandoy is one of the few sand dunes in the Faroe Islands and has a diverse plant and wildlife. It is also the habitat of plant species that are not found anywhere else on the islands.

The conservation orders require that areas are preserved in their original form. Any kind of construction, erection of fences and the like which may mark the landscape is prohibited. It is also forbidden to remove stones, sand, soil, plants and animals from the areas. However, the orders do not restrict the continued use of the areas for agricultural purposes, including cultivation.





International protection – Ramsar sites


A small flock of Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) on the grassy coastal slopes of Mykines; easily recognisable by their brightly coloured beak, which has earned them the nickname ‘sea parrot’. The iconic bird from the auk family spends its life at sea but comes to the Faroe Islands in March-April to bring the next generation into the world. They have been vital to the birding activities on the islands, and in 1939 the total catch of Atlantic puffin in the Faroe Islands was estimated at 200,000 birds per year.

OLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2008 In 1977, the Faroe Islands and Denmark acceded to the Ramsar Convention, which is an international agreement that aims to protect wetlands of international importance, including areas that are important habitats for birds. The convention also covers bird cliffs and other seabird habitats. Nólsoy, Skúvoy and Mykines were designated as Ramsar sites in 2012. The areas include the entire area of the islands as well as a zone that extends 500 m from land.

With approx. 50,000 pairs, Nólsoy has one of the world’s largest populations of European storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus). The world’s largest colony is in Urðin on the southeast side of the island where a prehistoric landslide has created a landscape of stones and boulders. In addition to the European storm petrel, Nólsoy is also habitat to a large population of Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) of around 30,000 pairs.

Skúvoy also has a significant bird life with a around 280,000 pairs of breeding seabirds. They include the Faroe Islands’ largest breeding population of manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) of about 10,000 pairs and 96,000 pairs of common guillemot (Uria aalge), which account for about half of the islands’ total population. To this should be added close to 50,000 pairs of northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) and 40,000 pairs of Atlantic puffin (Fratercula artica grabae). European storm petrel and golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) also breed on the island.

Mykines is particularly known for being the habitat of the Faroe Islands’ largest breeding colony of Atlantic puffins of around 125,000 pairs. The Atlantic puffins thereby make up around half of the 250,000 pairs of seabirds that use the island as a breeding and foraging area.

Management plans (Ramsar plans) have been prepared for all three Ramsar sites, which define the threats to bird populations and make proposals for protecting the bird life. The plans are formulated by local Ramsar committees that consist of people from the local area as well as representatives from the municipality and the national authorities. The committees, which meet about once a year, make recommendations to authorities and other stakeholders, but do not act as an authority.

Among the biggest threats to the birds are disturbances during the breeding season from e.g. coastal, fast-sailing boats and traffic in the breeding areas. Legislation has therefore been adopted to limit the sailing speed near the islands, and measures have been introduced to limit traffic during the birds’ breeding season. Rats and cats are also serious threats to the birds. Today, the brown rat has yet to be found on 11 of the 18 islands, and various measures have been introduced to ensure that rats do not get to Nólsoy, Skúvoy, Mykines and the eight other islands where rats have not been found via, e.g., feed and other goods transported to the islands. In addition, the municipalities are required by law to regularly monitor the presence of rats and to draw up contingency plans that can be put into action if rats are observed on the islands. At village gatherings where a village under the leadership of the sheriff can establish local bylaws, it has been decided to completely ban keeping cats on Skúvoy, while an upper limit has been set on the number of cats on Nólsoy, in order to protect birdlife.

Bakkafrost


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Salmon portions are being produced in Bakkafrost’s large finished goods production hall in Glyvrar.

OSCAR SCOTT CARL/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2019 The salmon farming company Bakkafrost is the Faroe Islands’ largest private employer and is headquartered in Glyvrar. The company was founded by the brothers Hans and Róland Jacobsen in 1968 and from 1971, the brother Martin Jakobsen also joined the company.

Initially, Bakkafrost processed herring from Skálafjørður and other fjords, which were salted, marinated, filleted and sold as tinned food, but other fish products were also exported. In 1979, the company was among the first in the Faroe Islands to venture into aquaculture with salmon and trout farming.

In 2005, it was re-established as Bakkafrost Holding, which has since seen continuous growth. On 26 March 2010, it was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and the company is now owned by both Faroese and foreign investors.

In 2011, Bakkafrost acquired the Havsbrún group, which produces fishmeal, oil and feed. This made it the only company in the world with a production and sales chain involving production of fishmeal, oil and feed, salmon fry and marine farming, salmon cutting, own box production and finished product production as well as sales to retail chains. In 2019, Bakkafrost acquired The Scottish Salmon Company, and the plan is to invest about DKK 2 billion in Scotland. The current CEO of the group is Regin Jacobsen, and the Chairman of the Board is Rúni M. Hansen.

Population and housing on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Population trends in the Faroe Islands 1966‑2021 and forecast 2022‑42. Index: 1966 = 100. HAGSTOVA FOROYA IB08010 & DST 1966‑1984 In 2017, the Faroe Islands reached a population of 50,000, and in 2021, the figure was 53,000. This is a result of the population trend changing in a positive direction from the mid-2010s with a large annual increase of more than 800 people, corresponding to about 1.5 %.

The figure shows the population trend since 1966 with a 20-year projection period. The graph shows the consequences of the economic collapse of the early 1990s, a partial recovery after the crisis until 2004, then a ten-year period of stagnation until 2014, and a new period of growth that is expected to continue, albeit more subdued. The positive trend in population size came after a ten-year period in which a large excess of births over deaths was offset by an equally large annual net emigration, especially among the young people. The reason was mainly the lack of higher education opportunities, lack of jobs outside the traditional professions and a cultural conservatism. Popularly, this period was called ‘Exit the Faroe Islands’.

The stagnant trend during the period 2004‑13 changed significantly from 2014. Emigration fell sharply and immigration increased, resulting in an increasing annual net immigration. ‘Exit the Faroe Islands’ turned into ‘Enter the Faroe Islands’. A number of positive factors contributed to this. Extensive growth in export industries such as fishing, salmon farming and the fish processing industry was followed by a general recovery where new jobs were created in all industries, major construction and infrastructure works were initiated, new jobs in tourism, restaurants and in new IT and research-based industries were established. In addition, a professionalisation was seen within art and culture, design and other creative subjects and in sports.

Targeted investment was made in the field of education with increased opportunities for higher education in the Faroe Islands, and research and technological development were given higher priority. Investments in cultural and leisure life at the same time made the Faroe Islands a more open and modern society. This made the country more attractive both for young people in the Faroe Islands and for many young Faroese living abroad, and many families with young children increasingly moved back.





From insular community to fragmented urbanisation


The Faroe Islands have a scattered settlement on 17 of the 18 islands. It was formerly an insular community, where 120 villages were separated by fjords, sounds and high mountains, and where it took hours or even days to get from one village to another. This is reflected in the exodus previously seen from the small islands and small villages in the outer areas to the large villages and the capital area.

In recent decades, the Faroe Islands have changed from an insular society to a more urbanised society at an ever-increasing pace. However, population growth has not only been concentrated in the capital area, but also in a more fragmented urbanisation, where islands, towns and villages have been linked together by the massive investments in infrastructure. This has led to a more even population increase in the capital and in the connected areas. For the same reason, strong commercial growth has also been seen in the connected areas.

Total fertility: children per woman of childbearing age (15‑49 years). The figures for Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway and Sweden are from 2020, the other figures are from 2019. NORDICSTATISTICS.ORG LIFE01 AND HAGSTOVA FØROYA





High fertility and average life expectancy


Across Europe, fertility has been decreasing for decades to a general level of well below two children per woman of childbearing age (15‑49 years), which is the requirement for maintaining a stable population in society. The average for the EU is about 1.5 and for the Nordic countries almost 1.7 children. The Faroe Islands are the exception with about 2.3‑2.4 children per woman over the last three decades, which is the highest figure in Europe.

In addition to the high fertility, the Faroe Islands also have an everincreasing average life expectancy. In 2020, women lived an average of 86 years and men 81 years. In Denmark, the corresponding figures are about two and one year lower, respectively, for women and men.

The high average life expectancy and the high fertility result in a relatively high excess of births over deaths, which is the first prerequisite for the natural reproduction and growth of a population. The excess of births over deaths in the Faroe Islands is about six per 1,000 inhabitants, which is slightly more than in Iceland and significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.





Migration – The Faroe Islands’ demographic Achilles’ heel


Population pyramids for the Faroe Islands 1989, 1996 and 2021; number of people by gender and age. HAGSTOVA FØROYA IB01020 Excess of births over deaths and net migration 1970‑2020. HAGSTOVA FØROYA In addition to fertility and excess of births over deaths, migration (the annual movement between the Faroe Islands and abroad, including Denmark) is the decisive factor for population trends. In larger continental communities, the majority of migrations take place between domestic regions, while migrations in the Faroe Islands largely take place across national borders. Therefore, migration has a far greater influence on population trends here than in the other Nordic countries.

Over the years, large fluctuations have been seen in the migration pattern between the Faroe Islands and abroad. Such a small community is extremely sensitive to economic fluctuations. With failing earning and job opportunities, an immediate reaction in the form of emigration typically follows. In good times, a greater immigration is seen, which will mostly be a return migration of Faroese youth and families with children.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, with major business and employment difficulties, a large annual net emigration of about 250 people per year was seen. During the period of recovery and growth in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a small net immigration of about 90 people annually. In the years 1989‑95, Faroese society experienced a total collapse of private and public finances. Businesses went bankrupt and thousands lost their homes; unemployment rose from being negligible to over 20 % during that period. The result was a massive net emigration of a total of 7,250 people, corresponding to more than 15 % of the population. In Danish terms, this would correspond to a net emigration of 750,000 people during these years. This massive emigration caused a strong distortion of the age structure, as illustrated by the figure, for 1989 and 1996, i.e. immediately before and after the crisis. The figure shows a drastic reduction of the young age groups up to 40 years in just seven years.

Since then, population composition has partially recovered as far as age groups are concerned. With increased immigration and population growth, the young generations have become significantly larger, thereby also creating a better basis for natural reproduction. On the other hand, the same demographic features are seen as in other European countries with growing older generations.





Positive effects of return migration


Immigrants with their own and another citizenship in 2019. NORDICSTATISTICS.ORG CHIL02 AND HAGSTOVA FØROYA Changes in the age distribution in the exit period 2004‑13 and the enter period 2014‑20. HAGSTOVA FØROYA The biggest positive changes in population numbers and structure are the result of immigration since the mid-2010s. For most Nordic and other European countries, the large number of immigrants are people of foreign nationality. For the Faroe Islands, however, most immigration is return migration of their own people who have lived abroad for a short or long time. Since the mid-2010s, almost 70 % of immigration to the Faroe Islands has been people of their own (Faroese-Danish) nationality. For the other Nordic countries, the proportion is 20‑25 %.

Compared to the so-called exitperiod 2004‑13, the enter period from 2014 has seen significantly higher growth in the younger age groups than in the older ones: In the years 2004‑13, the group of inhabitants under 40 years of age was reduced by more than 2,700 people, while the group of inhabitants over 40 years of age increased accordingly. The development during the years 2014‑20 was quite the opposite, as the group of inhabitants under 40 increased by about 2,600 people, while the group of inhabitants over 40 increased by about 2,200.

If the high level of employment can be maintained and major setbacks avoided in the future, it might be possible to keep emigration at this relatively low level. The return migration to the Faroe Islands is expected to slow down, as the pool of previously emigrated Faroese is limited, and only a small part of the immigration is people with a nationality other than Faroese-Danish. Therefore, falling net immigration is expected, meaning that a fair balance between immigration and emigration will be created. In that case, population growth will consist only of the natural excess of births over deaths, and annual growth rates at a level corresponding to about a third of the level in the latter half of the 2010s will be seen. Added to this is the contribution to population growth from an increasingly longer life expectancy, which will increase the number of people in the older generations.

According to the forecasts, the future will therefore see subdued population growth, approaching 57,000 inhabitants in the late 2030s. The ability to maintain positive population growth will be decisive for the further trend.





Housing conditions, housing types and household sizes


Average prices for houses sold in small and large villages and towns and in Tórshavn 1985‑2020. HAGSTOVA FØROYA IP04010 Over time, many summer houses have become at least as big as traditional houses for permanent habitation. The picture illustrates a new summer house area in the village of Gjógv where the guests will soon outnumber the permanent residents. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 Most homes are detached houses or farmhouses. This is due to a long tradition of families buying a plot of land, often parcelled out by the municipality, on which they build the house. Most families therefore own their own home. In 1977, 85 % of homes were owner-occupied, while this figure had fallen to 80 % at the last census in 2011. A slow development is seen towards more rental housing.

In addition to detached houses and farmhouses, there are also terraced, linked and semi-detached houses, and, especially in recent years, actual multi-storey housing or blocks of flats have been built, especially in the Tórshavn area. In 2010, there were about 500 homes in southern Streymoy consisting of terraced houses or flats, while the number had almost doubled by 2020. Construction of flats, in particular, has contributed to this growth. On Norðoyggjar (the Northern Islands) a similar growth in the number of flats can be seen, but the numbers are still quite small compared to the detached houses and represent only one twentieth of the total housing construction on the national scale. In 2020, about 95 % of the housing stock was still single-family homes. In 2010, this figure was 98 %.

The development of the road network, where mountain tunnels and undersea tunnels have reduced travel times, has affected the housing pattern. In particular, this has opened up new opportunities for working in the capital area and living in nearby areas where the rent is lower. This has affected the development of housing prices for houses in Tórshavn, where prices are more than twice as high as outside Tórshavn and are also rising faster than in other regions.

The average household size was 2.9 people in 2020. This number is slightly lower on Sandoy and Suðuroy, while otherwise there are only small regional differences. However, the household size has fallen significantly compared to the 1977 census, when it was 3.7 and on southern Eysturoy over four. By comparison, the average household size in Denmark was 2.1 in 2020.

In 2020, about 9 % of the population lived in single-person dwellings, and this figure has more than doubled since the 1977 census. The corresponding figure in Denmark was 18 % in 2020. Large regional differences are seen in the proportion of single-person dwellings: from 7 % on southern Eysturoy to 13 % on Sandoy.





Trends in regional population


New housing blocks in Hoyvík by Tórshavn in 2021. Housing construction in Hoyvík has developed explosively in recent decades. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS The maps above show the trends in regional population from 1966 to 2021. During this 55-year period, the population increased from about 37,000 to around 53,000, corresponding to 43 %. The Tórshavn area has experienced the biggest growth with the southern part of Streymoy doubling its population with a growth of over 10,000 inhabitants. To this should be added the neighbouring areas, especially southern Eysturoy. Here, the population has grown by 62 %, corresponding to some 4,000 people, reinforcing the area’s position as the most densely populated in the Faroe Islands.

Other growth areas are northern Streymoy with 39 % and Vágar with the airport with 34 % during the period. Growth is more moderate in the second largest urban area, the Klaksvík area, which has increased its population by around 1,100 people or 25 % during the period.

The southern islands of Sandoy and Suðuroy, whose population has been reduced by around 20 %, pull in the other direction. The same decline is seen on the northern islets, and an even greater decline can be seen in the southwestern islets, where the population has been more than halved.

Energy supply on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	With a battery system specially developed for the Faroe Islands’ electricity system, SEV’s wind farm in Húsahagi outside Tórshavn marked a significant step forward in the green transition. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 From ancient times, peat has been cut, dried and used as fuel for heating and cooking. Driftwood was also used for that purpose, while whale oil and later kerosene were used for lamps. Peat was cut up well into the 20th century, when coal, coke and oil – especially kerosene – had become common fuels.

At some point, a significant part of the coal consumption came directly from coal mines in the northern part of Suðuroy, where mining activities have been carried to some extent since about 1770. Coal mining has mainly taken place in the mines in Prestfjall and Rókhagi in the village of Hvalba, where coal is still mined in limited quantities. In addition, there have been coal mines in the village of Fámjin and in Rangabotnur by the village of Trongisvágur, which is part of Tvøroyri, the largest town on Suðuroy. Coal mining on Suðuroy had a special significance during World War II. Coal seams are also found on Mykines and Vágar, but it has not been profitable to extract coal.

In the late 1800s, development in the electrical field, both within water turbines and electricity transmission over long distances, had gained traction in both industry and in private homes abroad. This also inspired the inhabitants of the Faroe Islands. The businessman and pioneer Ólavur á Heygum made the first experiments with hydropower in Fossá in the village of Vestmanna in 1907. He fought for the hydropower project which was to produce electricity for Vestmanna, but did not get funding for the project before his death in 1923.

ERIK PETERSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX FACTS ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM The Faroe Islands’ electricity system has a total production capacity of 165.75 MW. Hydropower: 40 MW Wind power: 24 MW (and 60 MW in 2022) Oil plants: 100 MW Solar power: 0.25 MW Biogas: 1.5 MW The high and medium voltage network extends over 1,000 km. At the end of 2020, there were 26,175 electricity meters in the country, 20,570 of which were installed in households.





The first power plants


After Heygum’s experiment with hydropower in Vestmanna, an initiative was also taken to utilise hydropower on Suðuroy. The first hydropower plant in the Faroe Islands was built in the Botnur valley west of Vágur on Suðuroy. The hydropower plant in Botnur was commissioned on 18 July 1921 and is still in operation. In the same year, an oil plant started producing electricity in Tórshavn. Ten years later, in 1931, the next hydropower plant started in Klaksvík.

In the first half of the 20th century, several private initiatives were also taken to start small power plants, both oil plants and hydropower plants with small turbines. These could produce electricity for individual households, small buildings or neighbourhoods.

As electricity became increasingly important, 19 municipalities took the first step towards an intermunicipal electricity company, which was to supply the three largest islands, Streymoy, Eysturoy and Vágoy – hence the name SEV – with electricity from hydropower from dams in Vestmanna. The electricity company was founded on 1 October 1946, and in December 1953, the Fossáverkið hydropower plant began production. In the following years, all municipalities joined SEV, which took over the old power plants and which is still responsible for the electricity supply. Thus, the company is jointly owned by the municipalities.





Oil companies in the Faroe Islands


The oil companies Shell and Esso entered the Faroese market in the first half of the 20th century, where they supplied oil as the most important energy supply for heating and transport as well as for business. As part of the international Shell Group, Dansk Shell was for a long time the sole shareholder of Føroya Shell. Likewise, through its activities in Scandinavia, the American oil company Esso was the owner of Esso Føroyar, which was later acquired by the Norwegian Statoil. A smaller Faroese company, Oljufelagið Føroyar, was founded in the 1980s as a counterweight to the big oil companies, but it was also later acquired by Statoil.

In 2007, the ownership of the Faroese oil market changed again. The Icelandic energy company Skeljungur acquired Føroya Shell, which changed its name to Magn. Skeljungur currently owns 48 % of the share capital. At the same time, Statoil ceased its activities in the country, and they were taken over by the newly founded 100 % Faroese-owned company Effo.

As a result, a duopoly has existed in the Faroese oil market since the first half of the 20th century. The two major oil companies have started to reorganise in a time with a focus on green energy. They want to participate as energy companies with wind power and other renewable energy solutions.





Vision 2030


In 2009, the Løgting for the first time adopted a climate policy that focused on reducing CO2 emissions and initiating the electrification of society where possible, and on increasing electricity production with renewable energy. In 2011, the Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs prepared an energy policy report stating that one of the main objectives was to electrify all energy consumption on land with more renewable energy. The subject was further discussed in the Virkisætlan action plan from January 2015 on the future electricity system in the Faroe Islands.

In continuation of the climate policy and the energy policy report, in 2014 SEV published its vision that all electricity on land must come from green energy sources by 2030, called Vision 2030. The vision was later supported by the Faroese Government in the coalition agreement after the general election in 2015, and since then all parties – the electricity sector, authorities, politicians and businesses – have worked towards the green transition in Vision 2030. However, they do not always agree on how the goal is to be achieved and how quickly all energy consumption can be converted to green energy.

In the long term, the overall green conversion covers less than half of energy consumption, since the conversion of shipping and air traffic to green energy is a separate issue that researchers all over the world are struggling with. However, the authorities are focusing on the maritime sector in the hope that the global development in this area will mean that a large part of the energy here too will eventually be able to come from renewable energy sources.

According to SEV’s calculations, the need for electricity on land will be about 700 GWh in 2030 as a large part of transport and heating will by then have been converted to green energy solutions, which must be supplied with electricity. These calculations do not include a green transition in the industry. This means that electricity consumption will increase by about 133 % in the period 2015‑30 – from 300 GWh in 2015 to 700 GWh in 2030. The figures are, however, conditioned by the development of society in general.

At the end of 2020, a total of 321 electric cars were registered, which is an increase of 302 cars compared to five years earlier, when at the end of 2016, a total of 19 electric cars were registered on the islands. The number of heat pumps for houses and buildings was estimated at over 1,000 at the end of 2020. The number of applications to the energy authorities for permission for geothermal heating went from two per year in 2012 to 235 in 2020 – a total of 803 applications in nine years.





Energy supply in 2020


The Faroe Islands’ first hydropower plant in Botnur west of Vágur on Suðuroy was commissioned on 18 July 1921. The power plant still accounts for part of the electricity production on the islands. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2017 The Faroe Islands’ total energy consumption on land and at sea is distributed mainly between ships, transport, industry, heating and electricity consumption, a total of about 3,800 GWh in 2020. In the big picture, oil accounted for 92 %, while 8 % came from green energy sources on land, mainly hydropower and wind energy but also energy from waste incineration. Ship traffic accounts for 41.3 % of total energy consumption.

The electricity consumption of 407 GWh was 10 % of the country’s total energy consumption in 2020, and about 38.7 % of electricity production came from renewable energy sources, mainly hydropower and wind power – but also with small contributions from biogas (0.34 %) and solar energy (0.04 %). The remaining 61.3 % came from the oil-fired plants. In comparison, about 40 % of electricity in 2015 came from oil, while about 60 % of the electricity was produced using hydropower and wind power, which was a record for green energy in the electricity sector.

In the period 2016‑20, a decline was seen in green electricity production, where the percentage distribution between oil and green energy sources came right down to the 2005 level. In 2005, the total electricity production was 245 GWh, spread over around 45 % renewable energy and around 55 % oil.

During the period, however, the Faroe Islands experienced rapid development in the fishing and salmon industry, great activity in the building and construction industry as well as substantial growth in population, which together contributed to an unusually high demand for electricity. For many years, the so-called normal growth in electricity consumption was 2‑3 % per year, but during the period 2017‑20, electricity consumption increased by over 5 % annually – albeit with an extraordinary growth of 9.7 % in 2019. At the same time, it has not been possible to sufficiently expand the green energy sources for electricity production in line with the increased electricity consumption.

Although the green production figures have been decreasing, five green energy sources were part of the Faroese electricity production in 2020 – hydropower, wind power and biogas, as well as solar energy and tidal energy on a trial basis.





Green energy sources


When SEV was established in 1946, the primary goal was to produce electricity with hydropower. Social development in the 1970s, however, made it necessary to expand with oil-fired plants. The company again expanded hydropower over a period of 30 years – from the early 1980s to 2013.

During this period, wind energy also became relevant in the Faroe Islands, and SEV made the first early experiments with wind power in Neshagi on Eysturoy in 1993. In 2003, the company entered into a partnership with the private company Sp/f Røkt, which set up three wind turbines in Vestmanna. In 2005, SEV installed three wind turbines in Neshagi, which were replaced by five new ones in 2012.

In 2014, SEV built a relatively large 11.7 MW wind farm of in Húsahagi outside Tórshavn with an associated battery system to stabilise the unstable wind power fed into the Faroese electricity grid after seconds or minutes. The battery system was developed specifically for the islands’ electricity system in a collaboration between SEV, the German wind turbine manufacturer ENERCON and French Saft Batteries.

The experience gained from the battery system in Tórshavn forms the basis for the new 6.3 MW wind farm in Porkeri on Suðuroy, where production started in November 2020. The battery system has capacity to store the unstable wind energy for up to half an hour and transform it into stable energy for consumers, which is a major advance.

In 2020, there were four wind farms on the Faroe Islands, of which SEV owns three, and Sp/f Vindrøkt, in which the oil company Effo owns half of the share capital, owns one. SEV is building another 18 MW wind farm at Eiði on Eysturoy, the oil company Magn is building an 18 MW one in Flatnahagi outside Tórshavn, and Sp/f Vindrøkt is behind a 25.2 MW wind farm in Hoyvíkshagi outside Tórshavn. These are planned to be commissioned in 2022.

According to the Electricity Supply Act, SEV is responsible for the electricity system, while electricity production – especially wind power – is put out to public tender, with the main aim of keeping production price at the lowest level possible. After a long period of investigations, the energy authorities have formed the basis for the production of biogas in the Faroe Islands. The largest salmon farming company, Bakkafrost, has subsequently also become involved in green energy with the biogas plant FÖRKA outside Tórshavn, which was put into operation in 2020. FÖRKA uses waste from the salmon industry, fish factories and agriculture in its production. The new biogas plant started supplying electricity to SEV in September 2020, and during the period September-December 2020, FÖRKA produced 1,357 MWh – equivalent to the electricity consumption of 1,200 households.

In December 2019, SEV put a solar plant into operation on a trial basis in Sumba on Suðuroy, which in 2020 produced 170,000 kWh for SEV – equivalent to the electricity consumption of 35 households – and the data collected corresponds to expectations. The production is about 80 % of what it is in Denmark.

In 2020, SEV also launched an experiment with tidal energy in Vestmannasund together with the Swedish company Minesto. Two of Minesto’s Deep Green dragons are chained to the seabed and float around in a figure eight in the water, generating electricity. It was a historic event when, for the first time in November 2020, it was possible to produce electricity from tidal energy.





Electricity system balance


Due to its isolated location in the North Atlantic, the country cannot, like Denmark for example, buy electricity from neighbouring countries. Therefore, a separate backup system is necessary.

In this context, hydropower is stable energy if there is enough water in the reservoirs. In comparison, wind energy is unstable energy that can be stabilised to some extent with battery systems. Biogas will also be a supplement, and solar energy, which is also unstable energy, will be another supplement for the Faroe Islands, especially in the summer, when there may be problems with water and wind power at times. If tidal energy is developed for sustainable energy production, it will be a 100 % predictable energy source.

The Faroe Islands’ major challenge in the green transition lies in the fact that a safe replacement must be found as a backup for the oil, which is the electricity system’s safety net with the oil-fired power plants Vágsverkið on Suðuroy and Sundsverkið on Streymoy, which are in daily use. In the future, the hydropower in Vestmanna, together with a pumping system between two dams in the area, must be able to fulfil the task as a green daily backup system. The system will pump up the water for reuse in electricity production, and it will be powered by excess energy from wind power. There is still a limit to how much wind energy the Faroese electricity system can hold, and excess wind energy can therefore be converted into hydropower.

With the pumping system as part of hydropower, oil will be phased out as much as possible to only be a safety net in the event that there is not enough green energy available in the Faroese electricity system. When the Faroe Islands have reached that point, the oil-fired power plants can be compared to the cable connection that Denmark has to Germany and Sweden as well as the rest of the European electricity grid, where the countries act as each other’s safety net.

The Faroese electricity grid is divided into a main grid connecting the central part of the country and a separate system on Suðuroy. Moreover, there are smaller network systems on the small islands. Most of the Faroese electricity grid is buried in the ground as cable connections. This means that they are not affected by stormy weather as the traditional high voltage lines are. As a result, the failures in the high and medium voltage network have been significantly reduced.





District heating in the capital


The first public plans for district heating in Tórshavn were formulated in 1980, and in the late 1980s, SEV and Tórshavnar Kommuna entered into a collaboration on district heating. This collaboration is run by Fjarhitafelagið, which supplies heat to customers in the capital, mainly excess heat from the oil-fired power plant Sundsverkið and from Tórshavn’s incineration plant. Most customers are households, but a few hotels, the national stadium Tórsvøllur, the college Glasir and several large buildings are also connected to the district heating system. The number of consumers has increased from 814 in 2010 to 1,469 at the end of 2020, corresponding to an increase of 80.5 % in ten years.

The main goal of Fjarhitafelagið is to continue expanding the district heating system in Tórshavn. Plans have been made to include more green energy sources in the heating system to become completely independent of oil. In addition to excess heat, Fjarhitafelagið wants to extract heat from other sources, with the biogas plant FÖRKA being the first to be connected to the district heating system at the end of 2020. The goal is for FÖRKA to deliver 1.3 MWh to Fjarhitafelagið annually, equivalent to heat for 400 households.

Excess energy from wind farms in Tórshavn for heating large water tanks and an electric sea heat pump are part of the future plans for Fjarhitafelagið, which is jointly owned by SEV and Tórshavnar Kommuna.

Industry and labour market on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Tourism has grown in the Faroe Islands and every year, many large cruise ships call at Tórshavn and some other ports for a short stays. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 The Faroese labour market and industry are characterised by a high level of employment, a high level of organisation and a competitive, adaptable and innovative industry.

Geographically, most of the Faroe Islands are tied together by a welldeveloped road network and tunnels, which has greatly increased the population’s ability to commute between the regions.

After having had a fishing and fish processing industry as the main industry for many years, the overall picture of Faroese industry is now more diversified. The fishing and fish processing industry is still important, but salmon farming has now reached the same export value as the traditional fishing industry, and the number of employees in the salmon farming industry and the land-based fishing industry is now at the same level. In 2019, the export value of salmon was just over DKK 4 billion and the export value of other fish just under DKK 5 billion.

The gross value within the resources industry. HAGSTOVA FØROYA The Faroe Islands have become a highly popular destination for tourists from all over the world. Tourism is therefore also an important part of Faroese industry, and it is estimated that tourism has an export value of just under DKK 0.5 billion.

Another export-generating industry is shipping, which has grown considerably in the last decade. Shipping as an industry is estimated to have an export value of approximately the same as tourism, but there are no exact figures for the export value for any of the industries.

It is worth noting that the various industries do not follow the same business cycles, and this helps to prevent major fluctuations in the Faroese economy.

Fishing industry and salmon farming


Traditionally, the Faroe Islands are a fishing nation that depends on good fishing and good market conditions. The development in the fishing industry is undoubtedly decisive for the Faroese economy, even if the industry is now supplemented by the farming industry. The industry can be divided into fishing and further processing of the pelagic fish species and demersal fish.

Traditionally, demersal species, such as cod and haddock, have been fished and exported primarily to the European market. This part of the industry has been challenged for many years, but in early 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic, the market price for demersal fish was on the rise. However, the Covid-19 pandemic created a difficult and uncertain market, which naturally affected the price. The large production, which ended up in warehouses, had an adverse impact on liquidity, and as of December 2020, there was a real danger that this would develop into an insurmountable obstacle for companies. During 2021, however, sales slowly picked up again, and the average price rose. At the same time, however, demersal fishing from the sea around the Faroe Islands fell significantly in 2021, so major challenges still remain for the part of the industry that relies on demersal fishing.

Since the end of the 19th century, fishing has been the Faroese’s most important means of livelihood, but it has now been overtaken by salmon farming. Salmon farming is a relatively new industry in the Faroe Islands, but the favourable conditions and high prices have given farming a boost. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 There are three pelagic production facilities for human consumption: Faroe Pelagic in Kollafjørð, Varðin Pelagic in Tvøroyri and Pelagos in Fuglafjørð. Compared to 2010, the export value of pelagic fish species has doubled to just over DKK 1.8 billion in 2019. The shipping company Varðin owns Varðin Pelagic together with Delta Seafood. Varðin and Varðin Pelagic thereby control both the fishing part and the processing part. With vessels such as Tróndur í Gøtu, Finnur Fríði and Gøtunes, Varðin Pelagic’s onshore facilities are guaranteed steady and reliable access to the raw materials necessary for optimal utilisation of the company in Tvøroyri.

After an organisational restructuring, the Faroese salmon farming industry has gone from being on the way to losing its importance to becoming a strong player in the international market. In addition, the industry creates more knowledge jobs at an academic level, which has not previously characterised the private business sector.

There are three salmon farming companies: Hiddenfjord (formerly Luna), Mowi and Bakkafrost, of which Bakkafrost is the largest. With its some 1,000 employees, it is also by far the largest private company in the Faroe Islands. Bakkafrost expanded at the end of 2019 by buying the Scottish salmon farming company The Scottish Salmon Company. In addition, Bakkafrost also owns FÖRKA, which will convert residual waste from the farming industry into biogas.

Building and construction industry


In 2022, the Faroe Islands are booming. Several large school buildings are under construction and large infrastructure projects are underway. As a result of the great demand in the building and construction industry, a shortage of labour is seen in the sector. The two largest companies are Articon and J&K Petersen.

The pressure in the construction industry has generally affected the trades in the form of labour shortages and wage inflation. In the mid-2000s, the situation was roughly the same as today. Legislation was therefore changed, making it easier to hire foreign labour from the EU, although the Faroe Islands are outside the EU and therefore not part of the European labour market. The result is that the trades now have a relatively high proportion of foreign employees. However, an upcoming period of low activity and standstill is feared.





Trade, service, tourism and shipping


Tourism is a growing industry in the Faroese Islands. Here, the Visit Tórshavn office is getting new advertising streamers installed on the facade. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2017 The trade and service sector has also grown during the boom. The sector has many small players, but especially the grocery stores have seen a development and two large players dominate the market: The SMS group with the stores Miklagarður, Bónus and Mylnan and the wholesale company Poul Hansen with the stores Á, Inn and Samkeyp. Added to these is Føroya Keypsamtøka (FK) or Coop in the Faroe Islands which started in 1952.

Tourism has also undergone rapid development following several successful international advertising campaigns, for which Visit Faroe Islands together with the affiliated advertising agencies have won a number of awards. The number of overnight stays increased by 25 % from almost 160,000 in 2015 to almost 200,000 in 2019. However, it has caused some unrest, because the small, picturesque villages have felt flooded by tourists. This has led to an increased focus on internal control of tourism and on its negative consequences for nature. For example, Visit Faroe Islands has developed the campaign Closed for Maintenance, which is based on the concept of voluntourism. It means that selected tourist attractions close to incoming tourists on a certain weekend, but that a limited number of volunteers can apply to participate in the work to restore the balance of nature.

A fourth industry that has grown in recent years is shipping. Around 320,000 gross tonnages are registered in FAS (Faroese International Shipping Register). The register mainly includes traditional cargo ships, tourist ships and service ships in the oil and farming industry. It is estimated that about 1,800 Faroese are employed in the shipping sector.





Commuting


The extensive infrastructure has given the Faroese much flexibility when it comes to choosing a place of residence in relation to their workplace. The newest undersea tunnel, the Eysturoy Tunnel, was commissioned in December 2020, and in 2023, the undersea tunnel between the islands of Sandoy and Streymoy will be completed. Today, just under 90 % of the population is able to commute from home to work without having to take a ferry, and when the tunnel between Sandoy and Streymoy is commissioned, over 92 % of the population will be able to do so.

In addition, the preliminary studies for an undersea tunnel from Sandoy to Suðuroy are planned, and if it becomes a reality, less than 1 % of the Faroese population will still rely on a regular ferry service for commuting. In addition, the Faroese labour market is characterised by the fact that a relatively large part of the workforce works outside the country. Some are employed on foreign fishing vessels, others in the oil industry, while still others solve tasks abroad for Faroese employers. In times of boom, it can be felt that a large proportion of the workforce is not available in the domestic labour market. At the same time, it is an advantage that a part of the workforce is not necessarily affected by unemployment at the same time as the Faroese labour market during periods of recession. The Faroese labour market is vulnerable due to its modest size, but the extensive commuting abroad creates the necessary flexibility. The same applies to the foreign labour: In times of boom, many foreigners are hired, and in times of recession, they are no longer on the Faroese labour market.





Participation rate, employment and unemployment


(30) Employees in the private and public sector, respectively, as well as in various areas in 2020. AM03031 Average incomes in 2020. AM03031 Unemployment has long been low. Even after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate in September 2020 was 1.6 %. The workforce is made up of 91 % of the population, and of these, 89.5 % are in active employment.

Of the people in active employment, 37 % are employed in the public sector, and 63 % are in the private sector.

Average income is more or less the same across the country. However, average income on Norðoyggjar is about DKK 100,000 above average income on Suðuroy. This can partly be explained by the fact that fishing is particularly dominant on Norðoyggjar and that some of the incomes are exceptionally high. At the same time, Suðuroy is the most isolated of the large islands, and there are few highincome jobs.





Social partners


Selected trade union years. J.P. STRØM, 1998 AND HELGI EIDESGAARD, 2021 The Faroe Islands has a rich tradition of employees organising in the numerous trade unions, while employers organise in employers’ associations. The degree of organisation is estimated to be among the highest in the world, especially in the public sector. But while a few years ago it was unthinkable not to be organised, this is no longer the case, especially after the closed shop agreements were no longer legal.

Most workers and builders are members of a trade union. There is or has been a trade union for the unskilled in many of the villages, which was especially important in the past, when the lack of infrastructure necessitated such a structure. Trade union organisation has therefore historically been determined by geography rather than trade. The Faroese Workers’ Association, Føroya Arbeiðarafelag, has 33 local units (3,899 active members as of 1 October 2020). Outside the association are the workers in Tórshavn and Klaksvík, who in both places are divided into associations for male and female workers. Although they are not united under a main organisation, there is a certain tradition for the five associations to negotiate collective agreements together. S&K, which organises employees in the clerical and commerce sector, and the trade guilds are also large in the private labour market. The white-collar union Starvsfelagið (before 2021 Starvsmannafelagið) is the largest trade union for public-sector employees and organises employees in the Faroese state, intermunicipal organisations and municipalities. However, Starvsfelagið has also signed a few collective agreements with Føroya Arbeiðsgevarafelag. These are mainly for employees in former public institutions, e.g. Føroya Tele and Posta.

The degree of unionisation of the working population (15‑64 years) in 2011. MANNTAL, 2011 Most employers, i.e. about 500, are organised in an employers’ association. The entire private labour market, with the exception of owners of fishing vessels, is brought together under Føroya Arbeiðsgevarafelag, which is responsible for around 40 collective agreements. Føroya Arbeiðsgevarafelag and its member associations are housed in Vinnuhúsið, which is also home to the Shipowners’ Association.

Historically, Faroese sailors have been good at organising themselves. Already in 1896, Føroya Skiparafelag (the Faroese Shipmasters’ Union) was founded, making it the country’s oldest still existing trade union. Later, navigators also joined this association. Together with Føroya Maskinmeistarafelag (Faroese Engineers’ Association) and Føroya Fiskimannafelag (Faroese Fishermen’s Association), these unions look after the interests of seafarers. Their collective bargaining parties are Føroya Reiðarafelag for the fisheries sector and Reiðarafelagið fyri Handilskip for employees on merchant ships.

There is no tradition of central organisations on the employee side, as is known in, for example, Denmark. The idea of a Faroese confederation of trade unions has often been put forward, but it has not come to fruition. When Covid-19 broke out in the spring of 2020 and the Faroese government had to start making crisis packages, a number of Faroese trade unions and confederations founded the Fakfelagsráði (Trade Union Council), which had to decide on issues of an general political nature. There are advocates for a Faroese confederation of trade unions, especially in order to stand stronger against the employers, who have organised themselves under one common umbrella organisation. However, these ideas have not yet gained traction among the trade unions.

The fishing industry on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	The gross value within the resources industry. HAGSTOVA FØROYA When the coastal nations of the North Atlantic expanded their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the 1970s, vast areas of sea that had previously been international waters became national fishing areas. Large parts of the fishing activities at sea thereby went from fishing in international waters to fishing mainly in national waters as well as fishing based on agreements between nations about quotas in each other’s waters.

Annual exports of fish products in the period 1993‑2021. UH01050 For the Faroe Islands, this meant that, in 1977, the country acquired the ownership and management rights of the fishing resources in an area of approx. 300,000 km2. However, at the same time, access to traditional remote fishing areas became restricted, so that the Faroese fishing fleet to a greater extent than before had to operate in Faroese waters. However, annual agreements are concluded with other coastal nations on access to fishing quotas in each other’s waters, and rights are mainly acquired by exchanging quotas with the EU, Great Britain, Russia, Norway, Iceland and Greenland. Fishing also takes place in international waters. This mainly targets migratory pelagic fish populations that are managed in cooperation with the coastal nations involved.

Faroese fishing can be divided into two main segments: bottom fishing and pelagic fishing. Most of the bottom fishing is regulated by fishing days that are allocated annually. The pelagic fishery, on the other hand, is managed via annual quotas. The regulation is based on scientific advice and management plans. In terms of quantity, pelagic fish make up a larger percentage than demersal fish, meaning that pelagic fish represent approx. 75 % and demersal fish the remaining approx. 25 % of the total Faroese catch. However, since demersal fish are generally sold for higher prices than pelagic fish, demersal fish represent a slightly larger share of the total export value than pelagic fish.





Bottom fishing


In recent years, Faroese catches of demersal fish have amounted to around 130,000 tonnes annually. Of this, about 80,000 tonnes are caught in Faroese waters and the rest in the waters of other countries, mainly off Iceland, East Greenland and Canada as well as in the Barents Sea and international waters. Demersal fish species are characterised by being stationary and rarely migrate over long distances.

Since the end of the 19th century, fishing has been the Faroese’s most important means of livelihood, but it has now been overtaken by salmon farming. Salmon farming is a relatively new industry in the Faroe Islands, but the favourable conditions and high prices have given farming a boost. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 This form of fishing is much more complex than pelagic fishing and consists of a number of vessels which differ considerably from each other in terms of size and fishing methods as well as suitability in relation to fish species and geographical fishing areas.

Small cutters operate in coastal areas and mainly catch cod, haddock, ling, tusk, etc. The crew typically consists of one to three people, and the trips are typically one to two days long. The fishing takes place by longline or jig.

Line boats also account for a significant part of the segment. The smallest only operate on the Faroe Plateau and the surrounding banks. Larger line boats operate partly on the Faroe Plateau and deep areas in Faroese waters, but also get part of their catches in distant waters, especially off Iceland, in international waters east of Canada and in Greenland waters.

Trawlers come in different sizes. The smallest are allowed to fish in limited areas on the plateau, mainly for flatfish, but the majority of trawling takes place in deeper waters, either as pair trawling or single trawling. Pair trawling, i.e. when two trawlers pull a bottom trawl between them, is widely used in the Faroe Islands. This is mainly done to use less oil compared with single trawling, i.e. with trawl doors through which the trawl is spread out horizontally. The primary fish species for trawlers around the Faroe Islands is saithe. There are also factory trawlers that operate mainly in the Barents Sea and in Greenland waters where they primarily catch cod and shrimp.

A group of fishing vessels use pound nets to catch halibut and monkfish around the Faroe Islands. In addition, scallops are caught to a limited extent on the Faroe Plateau, and langoustine is caught in fjords and sounds using baskets.





Pelagic fishing


The trawler Steintór pulls the trawl in the waters off the Faroe Islands. Trawlers of this size mainly operate in the deep waters. ERIK CHRISTENSEN/CREATIVE COMMONS/WIKIMEDIA, 2011 Pelagic fishing is more homogeneous than demersal fishing and takes place with large trawlers or combined purse seiners to catch mainly blue whiting, mackerel and Atlantic-Scandinavian herring. In most ships, the fish is stored in cooling tanks in chilled seawater, after which it is landed at factories. Some ships are equipped with a factory for cutting fillets, extracting fish oil and producing fish meal.

Herring generally comes in shoals. Fishing takes place mainly in the Norwegian Sea with pelagic trawls. LARS LAURSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2013 Species such as blue whiting, mackerel and herring are found high in the water column and often migrate over long distances in relatively fixed, seasonal migration patterns between spawning grounds, rearing grounds, feeding grounds and sometimes also overwintering areas. All three populations migrate to feeding grounds in the Norwegian Sea during spring and summer where there is an abundance of zooplankton. The migration patterns of the fish mean that the populations cross several national borders each year, and they are therefore considered common property among the coastal nations in which they migrate. The fishing fleets of the nations involved follow the migrations of the populations, and, if bilateral agreements have been made, they are allowed to fish within each other’s zones.

Faroese catches of pelagic fish and demersal fish in the period 1997‑2021. VV01520 Faroese catches of the primary species of pelagic fish during the period 1997‑2021. VV01520 Blue whiting is the species mostly caught by Faroese fishermen. This fishing began in the 1970‑80s and increased substantially in the 1990s. Fishing takes place with pelagic trawls.

Of the three pelagic fish species mentioned, herring has been caught the longest by the Faroese. In the 1950s and 1960s, herring fishery was quite substantial for that time, especially east and north of the Faroe Islands, but it stopped when the herring population collapsed in the early 1970s. Fishing resumed with larger and more modern vessels when the population had recovered in the 1990s. Fishing takes place in the Norwegian Sea, in Faroese, Norwegian, Icelandic and international waters.

Mackerel fishery has undergone major changes in recent years. Up until the mid-2000s, the Faroe Islands had a modest share of the total mackerel catches. However, towards the end of the 2000s and in the following years, the mackerel expanded its summer feeding migration westward into Faroese and Icelandic waters. This meant that the country’s catch of the population increased accordingly.

Both blue whiting, herring and mackerel are mainly landed at factories that either freeze or process the fish.





From herring barrels to factory ships


The factory ship Norðborg, based in Klaksvík, on its maiden voyage in 2009. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2009 The extensive catches of herring north of the Faroe Islands after World War II led to a lot of work on land with the herring, which was salted in barrels and exported to, e.g., East Germany and Sweden.

A herring factory was built in Fuglafjørð in 1966. Other small herring meal factories were located in Gøta, Tvøroyri, Klaksvík and Velbastaður, which made feed for, e.g., mink. In 2019, the export of fish meal and feed amounted to DKK 527 million.

In the 1970s, a number of factories were built to process herring, which was put in glass and thus became a finished product. In the 1980s, attempts were also made to produce surimi (crab sticks) from blue whiting both on board ships and on land, but the experiments proved futile.

When the quotas on pelagic fish increased from the year 2000, the shipowners wanted to get as much as possible out of mackerel, herring, blue whiting and capelin. Three factories have thus been established to make quality products since 2005, and in 2009, the first factory ship in the pelagic fishing fleet, Norðborg, came to the Faroe Islands. The intention was to process the entire pelagic catch and to increase the quality. On board Norðborg, herring and mackerel could be used to produce various products besides fishmeal and fish oil.

One example from 2016 is the approx. 40,000 tonnes of pelagic fish, which had a value of DKK 107 million when the catch came ashore unprocessed. However, after the fish had been frozen whole and packed either on board or on land, the value increased to DKK 179 million, i.e. an increase of 67 %. Another advantage is that the quality-improved product weighs a third less than if it is exported completely frozen, thereby significantly reducing export costs. By refining the frozen fish, you can achieve an additional 9 % in quality improvement. Quality improvement can, for the entire pelagic catch, generate between DKK 200 and 300 million more in income for the fishing industry.

Today, a significant part of the fishing industry takes place on board factory ships equipped with filleting machines and freezing capacity. The longline ships, which 10‑15 years ago sold the catch as fresh fish, have now almost all got cargo holds for freezing.





From dried cod to filleting factories


Among the many fish factories that opened in the 1960s and 1970s was Bacalao in Tórshavn, which produced dried cod. Photo from 1974. SIGURD BECH/RITZAU SCANPIX Tórshavn around the year 1900. The salted cod is spread out on the rocks to be dried. This was mainly women’s work under the supervision of a foreman. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK The fishing industry developed after the Icelander Holger Jacobæus came to the Faroe Islands in 1844 to teach the Faroese how to process dried cod. Previously, the fish had only been split and dried.

Catches increased when the first sloops came to the Faroe Islands in the 1870s. The first houses for drying fish were built at the beginning of 1900, and in the 1930s, they were replaced by modern houses where the fish was dried with air from motor-driven machines. That made it possible to produce dried cod all year round. From 1870 to 1960, dried cod and salted fish made up the majority of the country’s exports.

During the 1950s, power plants were built all over the Faroe Islands. This meant that the fish could now be frozen, and from the end of the 1950s and into the 1960s, a number of filleting factories were built where the fish was cut into fillets and frozen in small packages. From the 1970s, when the fishing boundary was moved out to 200 nautical miles, the catch of fresh fish grew significantly; more factories were built and they invested heavily in filleting machines and cold storages. However, even though all the factories had filleting machines, labour was still needed, since each fillet also had to be trimmed.

Both in national politics and not least in local politics, efforts were as much aimed at creating jobs as establishing a profitable industry. Filleting factories were established in almost all the large villages, and in 1978, there were 21 factories with a total of 1,249 employees – 606 men and 643 women. Despite public funding, the filleting industry as a whole made losses and many factories went bankrupt. After the economic crisis in 1992, the number of filleting and salt fish factories was reduced to seven.

Today, around 600 people work with filleting cod, saithe, haddock and other species of demersal fish. Of these, 300‑400 are employed at the two largest factories, which are also the most stable because they have secured the supply of raw materials by having ships affiliated with the companies. Most factories block-freeze the fillets, while two or three salt them.

Saithe is mainly exported to countries in the EU, especially Germany, France and Poland. Cod is mainly exported to Great Britain, Poland and Denmark, and haddock is exported to Great Britain. The salted fish is exported to Spain, Italy and Portugal.

Cod is the most expensive demersal fish, and in 2019, the country’s export totalled DKK 1.2 billion. The export value of frozen cod fillets amounted to DKK 353 million, while the whole frozen cod had a value of DKK 203 million. The salted fish factories’ export totalled DKK 246 million and exported split cod fillets for DKK 217 million.

In the same year, the export of saithe amounted to DKK 273 million, of which the export of frozen fillets accounted for DKK 234 million. The export of haddock amounted to DKK 184 million, mainly as export of whole, chilled fish. The factory trawlers’ catches of cod and haddock, which are mainly caught in the Barents Sea, are included in these figures.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur During the economic crisis in 1992, Hiddenfjord built a salmon fry breeding centre, which has since been expanded several times. Hiddenfjord began its salmon farming on Vágar outside the villages of Miðvágur and Sandavágur in the mid-1990s, and from 2006, Hiddenfjord took over the salmon farming in Sørvágsfjørður. In 2007 they established a salmon slaughterhouse and started processing salmon products in their own buildings. Hiddenfjord is one of the most important employers on Vágar.

In 2019, Hiddenfjord set up breeding facilities in the open sea on the northern side of Vágar outside Víkar, and in 2020, current measurements were made in Vestmannasund, the sound between Vágar and Streymoy, with a view to future farming in the area.

Municipalities on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 Currently, there are 29 municipalities in the Faroe Islands. Over 40 % of the inhabitants live in Tórshavnar Kommuna, while the two smallest municipalities have only 38 and 41 permanent residents. The distinctive municipal structure reflects a historical development in local communities with strong local affiliations, which have defied the national authorities’ aim to reduce the number of municipalities to between seven and nine.





Historical background of the municipalities and their establishment


Map of the Faroe Islands and Tórshavn published in 1720 under the title Søe og Landcort over Færøerne Anlagt af R: Iuel Aar 1709 og 1710, sampt Prospecten af same Øer og Torshaun tagen paa Freg: Søe-Rideren 1720 by K. Benstrup. Origin: Rasmus Juel, K. Benstrup and N.C Hals. Coloured hand drawing. Note that east is up on the map. ROYAL DANISH LIBRARY The municipalities serve several functions: Firstly, the local community needs an arena to resolve local interest disputes. The roots of the Faroese municipalities can be found in the old villages’ medieval systems of government. The system of so-called grannastevna is still used to some extent in connection with the regulation of the villages’ common natural resources, etc. This is done according to rules and procedures laid down in Seyðabrævið from 1298, the Faroe Islands’ first and fundamental court records. Secondly, the central government needs to supervise the local communities. After the Reformation, the vicars became the auxiliary arm of the state; each of the 39 churches constituted a parish, which was distributed among the seven superior parishes. Thirdly, local democracy in contemporary society has led to demands and obligations regarding infrastructure and welfare, which make municipalities dependent on their own tax revenue as well as subsidies from national authorities to cover investment and operating expenses.

The first steps towards the modernisation of local self-government and local administration came with the Act on Poor Relief in the Faroe Islands from 1855. Accordingly, the seven parishes and Tórshavn were to have a governorship. The same structure was used for the municipalities, which were established a few years later on the initiative of the Løgting (the national parliament).

In 1866, the Act on the Town of Thorshavn’s Financial Administration was passed, which said that the ‘Administrative Officer and the Town’s Representatives should Jointly’ undertake management of the town. In 1908 came the Act on the Town of Thorshavn’s Municipal Government; now all members of the town council had to be elected.

The rest of the country was divided into seven municipalities according to an act from 1872. In the opinion of the Løgting, the starting point should be the 39 small parishes rather than the seven superior parishes (prestagjald), but in Copenhagen it was believed that the units would be too small. As a compromise, the governorships, consisting of five to nine members, were to have at least one representative from each parish, and each of the 39 parishes was to be an independent financial unit, managed by a parish commission.

An important background for the Løgting’s desire to establish municipalities was the introduction of compulsory schooling. Other special tasks included infrastructure, and the first many years were characterised by investments in port facilities and road construction, but also in the construction of school buildings and churches. Danish state aid (later Faroese national aid) to realise construction projects could provide a welcome extra income for the municipality’s residents. On the other hand, it was not popular if projects which only benefited one village entailed taxation of the entire municipality, or if the governorship of poor local communities imposed compulsory work distributed between the villages. This led to the establishment of new municipalities, and the first breakaway municipality was Nólsoy in 1876. In the year 1900, the original seven municipalities had turned into 15, and the number continued to rise to 51 in the years 1967‑76, when it was at its peak. The changes in the municipal structure are reflected in the terminology: The ‘governorship’ stipulated in the Municipal Act became ‘parish council’ in popular parlance.





Cross-municipal collaborations and amalgamations


In 1966, a committee was set up to revise the Municipal Act. Much had changed. The population had almost quadrupled, from 9,992 in 1870 to 38,433 in 1970. Money economy had more or less replaced the former subsistence economy, and more towns and new villages had emerged. Since 1948, the home rule had had overall responsibility for the municipal sector and for areas of interest to the municipalities, e.g. roads, ports, electricity and telephone. There was a shortage of labour, and welfare institutions such as kindergartens and nursing homes were needed to free the women from unpaid care work so that they could enter the labour market. These increased demands led to new cross-municipal collaborations within schools, childcare, elderly care, refuse collection services, electricity, etc. Since 1967, the common interests of the municipalities have been taken care of through a joint national association, which is now called Kommunufelagið.

The municipalities’ population as of January 1st 2022. HAGSTOVA FOROYA IB01030 The national authorities wanted the new Municipal Act from 1972 to lead to fewer municipalities, but at the turn of the millennium there were still 48 municipalities. Many of these had actively supported the local business community, and this was considered to be one of the explanations for the economic crisis of the early 1990s. A new act from 1993 therefore placed limits on the municipalities’ freedom with regard to how municipal funds were allocated. Furthermore, an investigation from 1995 on the municipal structure and administration and the division of tasks between the state and the municipalities formed the basis for a new municipal act in 2001. The goal was now seven to nine municipalities, but the Løgting still only wanted voluntary amalgamations of municipalities.

At the municipal elections in 2004, the number of municipalities was reduced to 34, and in 2008 to 30. Tórshavn, Klaksvík and Runavík incorporated small neighbouring municipalities, while Eystur, Vága and Sunda Kommunar are new municipalities that were formed by merging municipalities that were roughly the same size. In the rest of the country, the municipal structure remained unchanged. The national administration argued that the national authorities could accelerate the process, but the members of the Løgting did not want to force mergers through against the wishes of the voters. In 2011, the Minister for the Interior tried to get a clarification by calling a referendum, but the turnout was only 32.7 %. In only nine of the municipalities did voters say yes to amalgamation, in six cases for their own municipality to become larger (Tórshavn’s voters were not among these), while in three municipalities, there was a small majority for what can be interpreted as a wish to dissolve their own municipality. In 2017, a single municipality disappeared from the map, so in 2021, the number was down to 29. The municipality, which was dissolved, had 39 inhabitants, and was not among the municipalities that had agreed to an amalgamation in 2012.





The municipal councils


The number of members in the municipal councils varies from 13 in Tórshavn to three in the smallest municipalities. The support for municipal elections is great, and the requirement that actual elections must be held, meaning that there must be two candidates more than the number of seats in the municipal council, is met. In the smallest municipalities, it has sometimes been necessary to nominate candidates against their will, but in most municipalities, the seats are contested and the turnout is high. In 2020, it varied from 81.1 % in Tórshavn to 94.7 % in Fugloy, and the average turnout for all eligible voters was 83 %.

Strong wishes to be elected are reflected in the gender distribution. Although women became eligible for municipal elections in 1908, and the first woman was elected in Tvøroyri in 1918, the proportion of women in municipal councils was only 5 % in 1984. In 1956, the first woman was elected to Tórshavn’s town council, but during the period 1960‑84, the same town council had no female members. Representation in the municipal councils became a goal for the women’s movement, which in some municipalities choose to nominate women on special women’s lists. The strategy was particularly successful in municipalities without lists from the established parties, and Vestmanna became the beacon when a women’s list gained a representative in 1976 and had a majority during the period 1992‑2004. This political mobilisation resulted in an increase from only 5 % (a total of 14 women) in 1984 to 11.5 % (33 women) in 1988. Since then, the proportion of women in municipal councils has gradually increased, and in the last two elections there have been no indications that voters prefer male to female candidates. However, the lower number of municipalities has led to political demobilisation, particularly among male candidates. The fact that the proportion of women is now 36 % can be ascribed to the efforts of the women’s movement and Demokratia, a public committee established in 2005 to increase the proportion of women in Faroese politics.





The tasks of the municipalities


Based on their knowledge of local needs and wishes, the municipal councils must make decisions about land use, investments and services for the local population. Tasks mandated by Løgting acts include spatial planning and building regulations, first-line preparedness in the event of fire, pollution, natural disasters etc., infrastructure (water, refuse collection, roads, port facilities, power supply), municipal buildings for primary schools, medical offices etc., central public supervisory tasks, such as child welfare and social institutions, e.g. daycare centres, and since 2014 also elderly care.

In order to be able to carry out the resource-intensive tasks, intermunicipal collaboration is extensively used: These are often facilitated by the municipalities’ joint national organisation, Kommunufelagið. These include collaborations on e.g. electricity supply (SEV), elderly care and child welfare as well as other types of tasks that the municipalities institute. Tasks within the cultural sector are not required by law, but many municipalities choose to invest in culture and leisure, especially sports facilities.

Responsibility for the primary school is shared between the national authorities and the municipalities. In 2009, plans were made to transfer the entire responsibility for the primary school to the municipalities, but the prerequisite was a series of municipal amalgamations, which were not carried out.

The municipalities’ primary source of income is municipal tax. While the national tax is progressive, the municipal councils set a percentage in connection with the annual budget resolutions, which applies to all the municipality’s residents. It can vary between 16 and 24 % of the taxable income, i.e. income after a basic personal allowance of DKK 30,000 and child allowance of DKK 5,000‑10,000. In 2021, Fugloyar Kommuna had the lowest possible percentage and the highest child allowance, while Vága Kommuna topped the table with a municipal tax of 22 % and at the same time only DKK 5,500 in child allowance; in Tórshavnar Kommuna, the municipal tax is 19 %, and the child allowance is DKK 8,000.

The municipalities have the disposal of their income under the supervision of the Faroese Government’s Ministry of the Interior. There is no equalisation between rich and poor municipalities.

Salmon farming on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	A mobile farm operated by the new large wellship Hans á Bakka built in Turkey and commissioned in 2015. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 For 50 years, fish farming has developed from fumbling experiments to becoming the Faroe Islands’ largest single export, and the country is currently the fifth largest salmon producer in the world. In 2020, the country’s three farming companies had a total of 1,600 employees. Salmon exports in 2019 totalled 78,000 tonnes, and the export value of salmon and salmon products was around DKK 4 billion.





Historical developments


The first attempts to farm trout and salmon were carried out in 1968 when the former skipper Júst í Túni started to farm rainbow trout. His experiments were based on Norwegian trout farming in the sea. Marine biologist Andrias Reinert travelled to both Denmark and Norway in the 1960s to acquire knowledge, and farming in the Faroe Islands is largely based on his study trip report.

Since the end of the 19th century, fishing has been the Faroese’s most important means of livelihood, but it has now been overtaken by salmon farming. Salmon farming is a relatively new industry in the Faroe Islands, but the favourable conditions and high prices have given farming a boost. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 Farming in the 1970s was experimental. The public company Fiskaaling (fish breeding) took over the farming in 1973 and slowly built up knowledge about both trout and salmon farming. The first private companies were established in 1980 based on this knowledge. Although annual exports in the years 1975‑80 only reached about 100 tonnes, production was stable; it was only trout, and the Danish supermarket chain Irma sold the product as trout portions.

Fishing opportunities at sea became extremely limited when the fishing boundary was extended to 200 nautical miles in 1977. It therefore became necessary to look after and cultivate the waters in a different manner, and this made the political authorities look at the opportunities offered by farming. In 1980, the Faroese farmers organised themselves in Føroya Havbúnaðarfelag (the Faroe Fish Farming Association), but it was not until 1988 that the politicians drew up the first farming act. Salmon farming was new worldwide and demand was high. The price continued to rise and reached DKK 70 per kilo in 1986.

Fish farm in Skálafjørður in 1970. The first fish farm consisted of dams built on the beach. P/F FISKAALING The high salmon price led to an enormous interest in farming. But any notion of sustainability was virtually absent, and many farms were located in the same areas, which led to serious disease among the populations. Together with the economic crisis, the situation led to a severe setback in the farming industry during the first half of the 1990s. Credit solutions and political intervention led to a fall in the number of farming businesses from 65 to 20, and foreign capital helped revive the industry. However, to avoid that it would end up entirely in foreign hands, the Faroese Government changed the law so that foreigners can now only own up to 33 % of a company.

The next major setback came during the years 2000‑05 in the form of the ILA virus, which put a stop to almost all farming. The price dropped as the disease ravaged the populations. The risk of financing the release of fry, where both fry, feed and wages might be lost, deterred the banks from granting loans to the industry. So the players in the industry therefore collaborated with the politicians and the health authorities to implement a disease prevention plan. This entailed that all farms in the country had to be dormant for six months before farming could resume. This new system, which specified that only one year of fish was allowed in a farm at a time, was primarily intended to ensure a clean environment and natural conditions to avoid stressing the salmon.

In 2005, the farming industry started to move forward again, but at this point only a few companies were left. After the subprimecrisis of 2007‑08, the number of farming businesses dropped further to about five, and in 2012, there only three were left.





Great power and great responsibility


The distribution of salmon exports in the primary markets in the period 1993‑2021. UH01070 The current industry structure emerged as a result of the changes made in the early 2000s and the mergers in 2012. Over the past 10‑15 years, the Faroese salmon industry has grown into a decisive international player while also being a force in society.

Salmon exports in the period 2010‑19. UH01050 The largest of the three farming companies is Bakkafrost, which accounts for over 80 % of the total production. Established in 1968 as a family company with trout production and other fish products, the company began to farm trout and salmon in 1980. Bakkafrost is a strong, vertically branched company that has been successful on the Oslo Stock Exchange since 2011 – for a long period as the farming company with the highest profit per kilo. The 2019 profit exceeded DKK 800 million.

The second largest company is Hiddenfjord (formerly Luna), also originally a family business, whose history goes back to 1929 and which has long held on to the family-based structure.

The third and smallest company is Mowi, formerly Marine Harvest. Mowi has activities in 25 countries and was the world’s largest producer of Atlantic salmon in 2020.

The Faroese farming companies paid a total of DKK 435 million in share tax, fishing fee and dividend tax in 2018. In addition, the farming industry pays 5.0 % in fishing fee for each kilo of salmon sold. The fee decreases when the price of salmon falls below DKK 36 per kilo.

In 2010‑20, exports primarily went to Europe, the USA and China, but since 2013, exports to the Russian market have also increased significantly. This followed Russia’s boycott of food imports from the EU and a number of other countries in response to political sanctions imposed by the EU. Since the Faroe Islands are not a member of the EU, the country was not covered by this boycott. It might therefore be a step backwards for Faroese exports if relations between Russia and the EU were to normalise again. Overall, however, Faroese exports are more geographically dispersed now than in the 2000.





Challenges ahead


The gross value within the resources industry. HAGSTOVA FØROYA The farming industry is biologically sensitive, and despite excellent results in recent years, the industry is in fierce international competition on a daily basis. It has therefore proven vital to engage in research and continuously develop methods that can optimise farming so that it remains competitive.

Annual exports of fish products in the period 1993‑2021. UH01050 The future offers great challenges. It was a useful step on the way, when the board of Fiskaaling and the political authorities in 2007 decided that focus in the future should be on research, development, consultancy and the provision of services, and that roe production should be discontinued. This happened at the same time as Bakkafrost undertook to save the Faroese salmon population and embark on roe production in the Faroe Islands after much of the roe had been imported since 2005. As in other countries, salmon farmed in the Faroe Islands is also plagued by salmon lice. The hope is that investments and research will lead to a tenable solution to this problem.

In 2020, there were a total of 38 places with sea farming, fry farming and experimental farming, respectively. In order to increase production, the farming industry has extended the fry production time on land, while at the same time experiments with farming in the open sea continue.

Agriculture on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	The gross value within the resources industry. HAGSTOVA FØROYA Although agriculture is today a small industry in the Faroe Islands, employing only a modest part of the workforce, and does not constitute a significant part of GDP, the traditional agricultural culture continues to be of great importance to Faroese society.

The uncultivated area outside urban and village zones is called the outfield, while the cultivated areas around towns and villages are called the infield. The outfield is divided into hagar, which make up the grazing areas in the mountains. There can be several owners or copyhold tenants in each hagi. In most places, the sheep have a right to graze in the infield from 25 October to 14 May. During the summer months, the infield is protected from sheep and other livestock, and the owner/copyhold tenant of the infield has a duty to fence. The owner of an infield may ask for winter protection and thus have the right of grazing of a hagi replaced against a fee.

The value of the agricultural land is still calculated in historical units: marka, gyllin and skinn, just as it is still divided into freehold land, where the farmers own the land, and copyhold land, where farmers lease the land and the rights of use. There are in total 374 copyhold tenants and a few thousand freehold farmers.

The copyhold land is administered by Búnaðarstovan according to the Act of the Faroese Parliament on Copyhold Land, which states that, in the case of a change of copyhold tenant, the retiring copyhold tenant will appoint his successor. Búnaðarstovan must approve the new copyhold tenant based on requirements for agricultural practice, agricultural education and residency requirements. Subsequently, a contract called a deed of tenure is drawn up. Freehold land changes owner either by inheritance or in the free market, and here there are no requirements for practice, education or residence.

Búnaðarstovan also manages around 500 leased cultivated plots of land called trøð and legutrøð. A trøð is a plot of land of about one ha, which is leased by the copyhold tenants to private individuals. Freehold farmers are mainly organised in Føroya Óðalsfelag (The Faroe Islands Freehold Association) and copyhold tenants in Bóndafelag Føroya (The Faroe Islands Farmers’ Association). Together, these two associations have established the company Jarðir to safeguard the interests of the landowners and the copyhold tenants in regard to outfield activities related to tourism.

Faroese agricultural subsidies amounted to DKK 17.2 million in 2018, corresponding to approx. DKK 345 per inhabitant. In comparison, the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the same year amounted to approx. DKK 875 per EU citizen.





Sheep farming


Photo from the village of Sandur in the late 1800s. The sheep have been driven into the sheepfold in early summer to be able to shear the wool off the sheep and earmark the lambs. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK All freehold farmers and copyhold tenants, as well as most of the tenants of cultivated plots of land engage in sheep farming. The number of adult ewes in the outfield is approx. 70,000, and on leased cultivated plots of land there is a further approx. 2,000. The sheep breed from the Landnam period no longer exists. A new breed was imported in the 17th century, and since then there has been negligible interference from other breeds. Thus, the Faroese sheep are a separate breed related to the old breeds in the neighbouring countries.

The sheep graze outside all year, and the intention is that they have free access to seek shelter from bad weather, either in a stone fold (ból) or simple sheep shelters. The sheep are gathered three or four times a year; in spring to medicate and vaccinate, in summer to shear the wool as well as to medicate and vaccinate and in autumn to medicate, pick animals for slaughter and recruit new ewes and ram lambs for breeding.

Sheep farming is mostly done as a hobby, and most freehold farmers and tenants of cultivated plots of land only have a few animals each. In addition, many farmers have so few sheep that their undertaking cannot be viewed as commercial. However, sheep farming takes up a lot of space. All sheep are slaughtered on the property, and several families are often involved in the slaughter. All sheep meat is hung to wind dry in a storehouse called hjallur. A small proportion of the meat only hangs for a short time and is eaten fresh. The rest hangs for longer and is eaten as fermented (ræst) meat, as dry meat or as skerpikjøt (very dry meat that hangs for over a year). Around 60,000 lambs and adult sheep are slaughtered annually and have an average slaughter weight of about 15 kg. The commercial farmers who sell sheep meat get around 70 % of the VAT refunded as public agricultural subsidies.

The sheep are either white, black, grey, brown or mottled, and they are only sheared in summer. The price of wool is low, and subsidies are provided for a wool intake where sheep farmers can deliver the wool, which is sorted according to quality and colour and settled according to quality. The wool intake sells the wool to the highest bidder. Until now, the sheepskins have been salted for export, but in 2020, the Løgting granted subsidies for tanning.





Cattle farming


Haymaking in Gásadalur. The old form of haymaking where the hay was dried has been replaced, and the hay is now wrapped in plastic bales or stored in special wells as silage.

JENS CHRISTIAN TOP/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2017 There are currently 15 cowsheds with around 780 dairy cows. Of these, ten are old tethered stalling sheds and five have one or two robots. New robot cowsheds are being constructed in 2022, and it is expected that a similar number of tethered stalling sheds stables will go out of production.

Around 60 % of the cows are of the Danish Holstein breed and around 40 % are of the Norwegian breed GENO. The farmers sell all milk to the Faroese cooperative dairy MBM (Meginfelag Búnaðarmanna), which is owned by all the milk producers, who each have a tradable milk quota.

MBM buys around 7,500,000 litres of milk annually and make 70 product types. The producers receive just short of DKK 1 in subsidies per litre of milk. There is political will to maintain milk production, and the dairy can sell the milk VAT-free as part of consumer subsidies to support a healthy diet for Faroese families.

There is no actual beef cattle farming, but meat from the milk production is sold. All animals are slaughtered on the farm and sold directly to consumers. Producers receive subsidies for the sale of beef, and additional subsidies are provided for veal. The feeding basis of cattle farming is self-produced grass and imported concentrates, and the aim is to achieve a maximum share of self-produced straw fodder. Subsidies are provided for new indicultivation and own production of straw fodder. The FÖRKA biogas plant produces electricity and district heating from organic waste from fish farming and manure from dairy farmers. In return, the farmers receive degassed manure as quality-enhanced fertiliser.

Since copyhold tenants do not own their agricultural land, they often have difficulty obtaining bank financing for permanent investments unless they provide an equivalent value as collateral. To meet this challenge, the Løgting has set up an agricultural fund, the purpose of which is to strengthen the agricultural industry through financing. The agricultural fund’s income comes from the sale of copyhold land for construction purposes, roads, etc





Potatoes and vegetables


Faroese are traditionally major consumers of potatoes, and around 80 % is imported, while the rest is grown in the country. Rhubarb and a number of other vegetables grow well in the Faroe Islands, but they are only grown to a limited extent and mainly for own consumption. Some farmers, however, grow rhubarb, beets, kohlrabi, radishes, cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, beetroot, leeks, etc. for sale. Currants, blackcurrants, gooseberries and strawberries grow well but are only grown for own consumption. In order to strengthen local food production, the Løgting provides support for experimental projects related to commercial vegetable cultivation.





Bird hunting, hare hunting and farm tourism


Previously, the combination of bird hunting, agriculture and fjord fishing played a vital role in the traditional food supply. Over the past hundred years, the hunting of birds has mainly been for common guillemot, Atlantic puffin, razorbill, northern gannet, great cormorant and northern fulmar. Some birds and bird eggs were caught in bird cliffs, while others were caught at sea. Today, birds are a delicacy with little quantitative significance, since the hunting has reduced considerably due to decline in most bird populations.

The hare was introduced to the Faroe Islands from southern Norway around the mid-19th century. The hare has gradually adapted to the Faroese nature and thrives on the many islands. Annual sales of hunting licences in November and December provide a contribution to farming operations.

The country is experiencing mounting interest as a tourist destination. In recent years, increased traffic in the outfield has caused a number of conflicts between the rural population and the tourist industry, but the tourism activity has also created new sources of income for the villages, where farmers and locals can offer guided tours as well as local food and cultural experiences.





Teaching and experimental activities


The agricultural authority Búnaðarstovan undertakes teaching and research as part of local, Nordic and international experimental and research projects. Various registrations of traditional sheep farming, feeding trials with sheep and cultivation trials with grass, grain, potatoes and berries are carried out.

Búnaðarstovan organises evening classes in agriculture-related subjects. The school is open to all interested parties, with priority given to those who are to take over a copyhold farm. Biology and science, plant science, livestock science, machines and technology, accounting and economics are among the subjects taught.

Politics and plans on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Election posters hung in Tórshavn in the run-up to the general election on 31 August 2019, where nine parties were on the ballot. TRÓNDUR DALSGARÐ/RITZAU SCANPIX The Faroese political system is based on parliamentary democracy. At general elections, 33 representatives are elected to the Løgting for a four-year period. The Faroe Islands were organised into one constituency in 2007; before then the country was organised into seven constituencies. All bills must go through three readings in the Løgting, and passed bills are confirmed by the Prime Minister and then announced on the official notice portal. All laws and executive orders are available in the collection of laws at logir.fo.

According to the Danish Constitutional Act, two representatives from the Faroe Islands must be elected to the Danish Parliament. Sambandsflokkurin (B) and Javnaðarflokkurin (C) each have their own representative in 2022: Edmund Joensen (B) and Sjúrður Skaale (C). The turnout in recent years has been 60‑70 %.

The Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands is elected by the Løgting if there is no majority against the proposed Prime Minister. The Prime Minister appoints the members of the Faroese Government. The Prime Minister manages and coordinates the work of the Faroese Government. According to the local Faroese administration, the Prime Minister distributes the field of affairs between the members of the Government.

The large hall in the Nordic House in Tórshavn formed the setting for the final party leaders’ debate on 20 January 2004 before the upcoming general election. THOMAS BORBERG/RITZAU SCANPIX Relations between the Faroe Islands and Denmark are based on the Home Rule Act from 1948, called the Home Rule Arrangement, and power is thus divided between the Danish and Faroese authorities. With the new Løgting Act from 1994, a system of ministerial responsibility replaced the previous one with collegial governance. The Faroese Prime Minister oversees ‘that each individual member of the Government administers his or her affairs in a legal and responsible manner’ (Article 33(3) of the local Faroese administration). Before the Faroese Government takes over, a government agreement is formulated that describes the goals that the Government has set for itself during its term in office.

On 13th of September 2019, the current government was formed between Sambandsflokkurin (B), Fólkafokkurin (A) and Miðflokkurin (H). Bárður á Steig Nielsen, chairman of Sambandsflokkurin, was elected as Prime Minister on 14 September. The Government has 17 of the 33 seats in the Løgting. The Government has six members in addition to the Prime Minister.





The political parties


After the election in 2019, seven parties are represented in the Løgting. Their share of the seats in the Løgting is determined based on their share of the votes, as the electoral system is proportional representation. Voter turnout is high, usually between 85 and 90 %. In 2019, the turnout was 90 %.

The parties are the following:

Sambandsflokkurin (The Unionist Party) (B) was the first party in the Faroe Islands, founded in 1906. A main goal of the party is to preserve the Unity of the Realm between the Faroe Islands, Denmark and Greenland, and the line is centre-right and social-liberal. The party has seven seats in the Løgting (20.3 %). The chairman is Bárður á Steig Nielsen.

Javnaðarflokkurin (The Social Democratic Party) (C) was founded in 1925. It is social democratic and places great emphasis on solidarity and wants to preserve the Unity of the Realm. The party has seven seats in the Løgting (22.2 %). The chairman is Aksel V. Johannesen.

Fólkaflokkurin (The People’s Party) (A) was founded in 1939. It has conservative- liberal values, places great emphasis on freedom and business growth and has an independent Faroe Islands as its goal. The party has eight seats in the Løgting (24.5 %), and the chairman is Jørgen Niclasen.

Tjóðveldi (Republicans) (E) was founded in 1948. The party’s main goal is for the Faroe Islands to be a sovereign, independent country. It is leftwing and its party programme focuses on equality and solidarity. The party has six seats in the Løgting (18.1 %), and the chairman is Høgni Hoydal.

Sjálvstýri (The Independence Party) (D) was founded in 1906 and was formerly called Sjálvstýrisflokkurin. The party, whose main goal is to work for a gradual transition to self-government, is social liberal. It has one seat in the Løgting (3.4 %). The chairman is Jógvan Skorheim (who is not a member of the Løgting).

Miðflokkurin (The Centre Party) (H) was founded in 1992 and its policy is based on the Christian values and on the family as an institution. The party program states that the Faroese nation should have full decision-making power and responsibility. The party has two seats in the Løgting (5.4 %). The chairman is Jenis av Rana.

Framsókn (The Liberal Nationalistic Party) (F) was founded in 2011 as a liberal, nationalist party that focuses on personal and professional freedom. The party wants the Faroe Islands to gain sovereignty. It has two seats in the Løgting (4.6 %); the chairwoman is Ruth Vang.





Tensions in Faroese politics


New housing blocks in Hoyvík by Tórshavn in 2021. Housing construction in Hoyvík has developed explosively in recent decades. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS The question of secession or unity with Denmark has been a point of contention for many decades. The main goal of the Faroese Government consisting of Fólkaflokkurin, Tjóðveldi and Sjálvstýrisflokkurin, which took over the leadership in 1998, was for the Faroe Islands to be independent, and it was therefore popularly called the ‘independence government’. A Faroese foundation was to be the basis for independence. Negotiations took place with the Danish government for independence and an interim arrangement, but no agreement was reached between the countries, and disagreements arose in the Faroese government about the referendum on independence.

Gender distribution among candidates for municipal elections and elected members in the period 1992‑2020 in absolute figures. KVF.FO, 2020 The Faroe Islands’ relationship with Denmark is regularly part of the political debate, and although the question of unity or secession has not been much debated in recent years, it is an important dimension in Faroese politics. To understand Faroese politics, however, it is not enough to look exclusively at the right-left and secessionunity dimensions. An at least equally important parameter is worldview or understanding of values on a scale from conservative to liberal. In connection with the consideration in the Løgting and in the public debate in 2016 about changing the Marriage Act to allow two people of the same sex to get married, the different understandings of values came out clearly. The conservatives wanted marriage to be maintained as an institution between a man and a woman, while the liberals wanted to allow marriage between two of the same sex. For example, Miðflokkurin, whose values are conservative, strongly advocated not adopting the law amendment, while Framsókn, whose values are liberal, recommended voting for the bill. The debate was often violent and emotions strong, both in the Løgting and in the public debate. The bill was passed (19 in favour, 14 against).

Added to this is the tension between the capital area (centre) and the rest of the country (periphery); local political considerations have a strong presence in Faroese politics. In recent years, the question of how the fishing resources should be distributed has dominated, and this has indeed brought the tension between the country’s different areas to light. This was particularly evident during the last government (2015‑19), when Javnaðarflokkurin, Tjóðveldi and Framsókn had the main goal of implementing a fisheries reform. During the consideration of the bill on the administration of sea resources (the fisheries reform), the dispute about the resources flared up between politicians on Norðoyggjar and politicians in the capital area. The reason for the fierce resistance on Norðoyggjar was the fear of losing the fishing rights, which are of decisive economic importance for Klaksvík and Norðoyggjar.

When decisions have to be made about drilling tunnels and expanding the road network, it is clear that local political considerations and interests weigh heavily. Politicians will basically work for the area in which they have received the most votes.

Before the Eysturoy Tunnel opened in 2020, the travel time between Runavík and Tórshavn was about one hour. With the new tunnel, the travel time between the two towns has come down to about 15 minutes. One can only guess whether the shortened physical distance will eventually manifest itself in a less conflicted relationship between centre and periphery.





The Faroese Government’s main goal


With a battery system specially developed for the Faroe Islands’ electricity system, SEV’s wind farm in Húsahagi outside Tórshavn marked a significant step forward in the green transition. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 One of the main goals of the coalition agreement is to restructure fisheries and thus make major changes to the system adopted by the previous CEF government. Early in the ABH government’s term in office, the Løgting passed the Marine Resources Act, which, among other things, abolished the auction of fishing rights and gave the industry use permits with a 12- year notice period, which the Løgting needs to confirm every year. It is generally agreed that the fishing industry must be sustainable and that the framework for this industry should be permanent and secure and not change significantly depending on which parties are in power. But there is widespread disagreement about how the fishery should be managed. The government has set out to pursue an ambitious energy and environmental policy that meets international requirements. The main goal for the energy area is for 100 % of consumption on land to be covered by renewable energy in 2030, which is estimated to require investments for about DKK 5 to 10 billion. Efforts are being made for private companies to have better access to SEV’s electricity grid in order to produce green energy. The aim is for a treatment guarantee to be established in the healthcare sector to make sure that waiting times to receive treatment will be no more than 30 days. The Faroese Government is also working to expand the housing market, and the plan is for the task to be carried out by both private actors and the public sector. Population growth in recent years has put the housing market under pressure, particularly in the capital area. Therefore, the issue has been a key subject in political initiatives and the public debate. One issue that several governments have been working on is new legislation in the social field. On 1st of January 2021, the Social Security and Services Act entered into force after the bill had been passed unanimously. Another area that enjoys wide support is digitalisation. In 2020, the use of digital identity started, which means that citizens and businesses can communicate securely and digitally with the public sector. An area that is sensitive and complicated for the Faroese Government is the issue of access to the outfield and regulation of the tourism industry. This is the cause of great disagreement, as the considerations are many and the interests are different. Efforts are therefore being made to find a satisfactory and broad solution. Several matters enjoy broad political support. Examples include green energy, free trade agreement with the EU and more powers in the field of foreign policy.

Thousands of participants joined the 2016 Faroe Pride parade in Tórshavn to show their solidarity with the LGBT community in the country. It is said that as much as 10 % of the population participates in the annual event. TRONDUR DALSGARD/GONZALES PHOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX





The Faroe Islands in the international community


The Løgting generally agrees that the Faroe Islands should be given greater leeway on the scene of foreign policy. There have been several rounds of negotiations at official level, and at regular intervals, the issue is discussed at meetings between the government leaders in the Unity of the Realm. However, results have been vanishingly few and small, which is a challenge.

As part of the Arctic, the Faroese Government will strengthen the Faroe Islands’ position, especially in the maritime area, in the emergency preparedness and with future resources in mind. In the Faroe Islands, the view is that the Arctic area should be an area of low tension.

The Faroe Islands are part of NATO, and today there is broad agreement on membership. Historically, however, the issue of NATO has led to controversy and demonstrations, especially in the 1960s and 1970s.

The country has major commercial interests in both the USA, Russia and China, and the goal is to have good trade relations with all three superpowers. In 2020, the Faroe Islands and the USA signed a Partnership Declaration, which aims to strengthen cooperation between the countries.

After a special service, they go back to the Løgting House, where the Prime Minister gives his opening speech. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS Jóannes Dan Eidesgaard (b. 1951)

Prime Minister 2004‑08. Eidesgaard is a primary school teacher and was first elected to the Løgting for Javnaðarflokkurin in 1990. He was Minister for health and social affairs in 1991‑94, Minister for finance and Deputy Prime Minister in 1994‑96. Eidesgaard was first Prime Minister and then Minister for Finance after the 2008 election. He did not run again in 2011. He was also party chairman in the period 1996‑2011 and member of the Danish Parliament in the period 1998‑2001.

Kaj Leo Holm Johannesen (b. 1964)

Prime Minister 2008‑15. Johannesen is qualified as a shipmaster and was elected for the first time in 2002 for Sambandsflokkurin. In 2019, Kaj Leo Holm Johannesen became minister with responsibility for the health sector. Johannesen was party chairman in the period 2004‑15; he was an alternate member of the Danish Parliament in 2007 and a member of Tórshavn’s town council 1997‑2000.

Aksel V. Johannesen (b. 1972)

Prime Minister 2015‑19. Johannesen has a master’s degree in law and was elected to the Løgting for the first time in 2011 for Javnaðarflokkurin. He was Minister for Health in 2009‑11 and Finance in 2011, and he became party chairman in 2011. In 2012, he was also an alternate member of the Danish Parliament.

Bárður á Steig Nielsen (b. 1972)

Prime Minister since 2019. Nielsen is an accountant and was elected to the Løgting for the first time in 2002 for Sambandsflokkurin. In 2004, he became minister with responsibility for finances.

Although Javnaðarflokkurin experienced a drop in support, the party, along with Sambandsflokkurin and Fólkaflokkurin, retained a majority after the election with 20 out of 33 seats in the Løgting. Javnaðarflokkurin formed a new government on 4 February 2008 with Tjóðveldisflokkurin and Miðflokkurin.

The Faroese Government: Jóannes Eidesgaard (Prime Minister, Javnaðarflokkurin). Appointed for Javnaðarflokkurin: Hans Pauli Strøm (social and health) and Helena Dam á Neystabø (justice); for Tjóðveldisflokkurin: Høgni Hoydal (foreign affairs), Tórbjørn Jacobsen (fisheries and resources), Kristina Háfoss (culture, 2008), Óluva Klettskarð (culture, 2008) and Bjørt Samuelsen (industry); for Miðflokkurin: Karsten Hansen (finance).

On 26 September 2008, a new Faroese Government was formed between Sambandsflokkurin, Fólkaflokkurin and Javnaðarflokkurin. The Faroese Government period 2008‑11 was characterised by many reshuffles.

The Faroese Government: Kaj Leo Holm Johannesen (Prime Minister, Sambandsflokkurin). Appointed for Sambandsflokkurin: Jóhan Dahl (industry, 2008‑11, fisheries, 2011) and Rósa Samuelsen (social); for Fólkaflokkurin: Jørgen Niclasen (2008‑11), Jacob Vestergaard (foreign affairs, 2011), Jacob Vestergaard (fisheries, 2008‑11) and Annika Olsen (domestic affairs, 2008‑11); for Javnaðarflokkurin: Jóannes Eidesgaard (2008‑11), Aksel V. Johannesen (finance, 2011), Hans Pauli Strøm (2008‑09), Aksel V. Johannesen (2009‑11) and John Johannesen (health, from 2011 domestic affairs). Helena Dam á Neystabø (culture, 2008‑11, municipalities, 2011).





The 2011 Parliamentary Election


Session in the Løgting in 2020 in the modernised Løgting chamber. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS Due to the economic crisis, the economy became the main theme of the election. The deficit on the Budget and different models for taxation of income were discussed extensively during the election campaign. Challenges and ownership in the fishing sector were also debated extensively leading up to the election.

The election result was a vote of confidence in Sambandsflokkurin and Prime Minister Kaj Leo Holm Johannesen. Fólkaflokkurin also had a good election, while support for the left-of-centre parties, Javnaðarflokkurin and Tjóðveldisflokkurin, declined.

On the 14th of November 2011, a right-of-centre government was formed consisting of Sambandsflokkurin, Fólkaflokkurin, Miðflokkurin and Sjálvstýrisflokkurin.

The Faroese Government: Kaj Leo Holm Johannesen (Prime Minister, Sambandsflokkurin). Appointed for Sambandsflokkurin: Bjørn Kalsø (culture) and Jóhan Dahl (industry and business); for Fólkaflokkurin: Jørgen Niclasen (finance), Jákup Mikkelsen (2011‑12), Jacob Vestergaard (fisheries, 2012‑15) and Annika Olsen (social); for Miðflokkurin: Karsten Hansen (health); for Sjálvstýrisflokkurin: Kári P. Højgaard (domestic affairs, 2011‑13). The government area for domestic affairs was abolished in 2013, and Sjálvstýrisflokkurin was not represented in the Government in the period 2013‑15.





The 2015 Parliamentary Election


The handling of the boom was a main theme in the election campaign. Topics such as deficit on the Budget, the wish for more revenue for the public sector and tax cuts characterised many of the debates leading up to the election. The other major election theme was the expected fisheries reform. The election was a big victory for Javnaðarflokkurin. The opposition made progress, while support for all the parties in the Faroese Government declined.

On 15th of September 2015, a new Faroese Government was formed between Javnaðarflokkurin, Tjóðveldi and Framsókn.

The Faroese Government: Aksel V. Johannesen (Prime Minister, Javnaðarflokkurin). Appointed for Javnaðarflokkurin: Henrik Old (2015‑18), Heðin Mortensen (traffic, 2018‑19), Eyðgunn Samuelsen (social) and Rigmor Dam (culture, 2015‑19); for Tjóðveldi: Høgni Hoydal (fisheries and culture, 2019), Kristina Háfoss (finance) and Sirið Stenberg (social and domestic affairs); for Framsökn: Poul Michelsen (foreign affairs, industry and business) and Hanna Jensen (education, 2019).

In 2019, the government area of culture was divided into education and culture and was transferred from Javnaðarflokkurin to Framsókn and Tjóðveldi, respectively.





The 2019 Parliamentary Election


Disagreement about the fisheries reform, growing tourism, a housing market under pressure and conversion to green energy were key topics in the run-up to the election. The opposition won the election, and Fólkaflokkurin became the country’s largest party, while support for the three parties in the Faroese Government coalition declined.

On 13th of September 2019, a new Faroese Government was formed between Sambandsflokkurin, Fólkaflokkurin and Miðflokkurin.

The Faroese Government: Bárður á Steig Nielsen (Prime Minister, Sambandsflokkurin). Appointed for Sambandsflokkurin: Kaj Leo Holm Johannesen (health), Helgi Abrahamsen (2019‑21), Magnus Rasmussen (environment, trade and industry, from 2021); for Fólkaflokkurin: Jørgen Niclasen (2019‑22), Uni Rasmussen (finance, from 2022), Jacob Vestergaard (2019‑21) Árni Skaale (fisheries, from 2022), Elsebeth Mercedis Gunnleygsdóttir (2019‑21) and Sólvit Emilsson Nolsø (social, from 2022); for Miðflokkurin: Jenis av Rana (foreign affairs and culture, from 2019).

Shipping Company Varðin


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The trawler Tróndur í Gøtu at the quay in front of the factory Varðin Pelagic in Tvøroyri. EILEEN SANDÁ/CREATIVE COMMONS, WIKIMEDIA, 2012 In 1985, the Faroese Government launched its so-called ship package, the purpose of which was to build Faroese ships for hake fishing in Faroese waters. In January 1987, Jákup Jacobsen and Tummas Thomsen’s shipping company was able to take its first ship, Tróndur í Gøtu, into Gøta.

When the economic crisis hit the Faroe Islands in 1990, it also affected the shipping company, and in order to save the ship, the crew decided to lower their own wages slightly and inject new capital into the shipping company. Therefore, Tróndur í Gøtu survived as one of only two ships; the ship package had included 16 ships.

Through the 1990s, blue whiting fishery was successful, and it was also possible to fish for herring and mackerel. This placed the shipping company in a good position when pelagic fishing became the dominant part of the Faroese fishing industry shortly after the year 2000. This allowed the shipping company to buy other pelagic vessels and their fishing quotas.

In 2011, the shipping company changed its strategy. Together with others, they decided to buy both ships and factories from the bankruptcy estate of Faroe Seafood. This company, Faroe Origin, has two filleting factories and six trawlers that mainly fish and process pollack. In 2012, a pelagic factory was built in Tvøroyri under the name Varðin Pelagic, where the company’s pelagic ships can land their large catches. Today, the shipping company has almost 400 employees, and the annual revenue is more than DKK 1 billion.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Restaurant KOKS, which was awarded its first Michelin star in 2017 and was awarded star number two in 2019, originally started as a restaurant at Hotel Føroyar. It soon developed its own identity and moved out of the hotel, first to Kirkjubøur and later to an isolated farm among sheep and mountains by Lake Leynavatn on Streymoy. The restaurant with its 26 seats was located here until the end of 2021.

Plans are made to build a brand new restaurant with overnight accommodation on Streymoy. In the meantime, KOKS has moved to the village of Ilimanaq south of Ilulissat on the west coast of Greenland. According to the plan, KOKS will move back to the Faroe Islands in 2024. From spring 2022, KOKS will also, under the name ROKS, operate in the two restaurants Ræst and Fútastova in old central Tórshavn.

Salt on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 Inside SALT’s great hall, the building’s impressive dimensions become apparent. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2022 The old salt silo at Drelnes in Ørðavíkarlíð has been restored and given new life as a cultural centre. It has retained the name SALT, which now stands for Sound Art & Live Theatre. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2022 Fishing and the production of salted and dried cod required large quantities of salt from the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century. For many years, schooners and salt steamers with salt from the Mediterranean area came to the Faroe Islands several times a year. What was not immediately loaded aboard the fishing vessels was stored in warehouses around the islands. However, this arrangement was not the most appropriate. Therefore, the general manager of the Danish branch of the French Compagnie Commerciale des Sels Marins, Otto G. Helwigh, and merchant Magnus Dahl and solicitor of the high court Edward Mitens, both Faroese, took the initiative to build a salt silo.

A public limited company, North Atlantic Salt Company A/S, was founded for the purpose. The share capital was DKK 100,000, of which the French salt syndicate owned DKK 70,000 and the aforementioned founders DKK 10,000 each. Edward Mitens became the public limited company’s first chairman of the board.

The silo, designed by a French architect, was built by the Danish construction company C.G. Jensen in Copenhagen and built at Drelnes near Tvøroyri, where plans had already been made to build quays for shipping coal mined in the nearby mountains. Construction began in 1937 and was completed in 1938, and it ended up costing about DKK 350,000. With a floor area of 1,000 m2 and a height of about 25 m, the silo could hold 10,000 tonnes. It had a 110 m long conveyor belt that could transport around 50 tonnes per hour.

The first cargo, 6,300 tonnes, arrived on the French steamer Albi on 17th of November 1938 and the first salt was shipped on 8th of February the following year to the fishing vessel Godthaab, owned by the local shipping company P/F N.J. Mortensen. On October 9 1941, the silo was bombed by a German airplane, and the extensive damage was compounded by a storm in February 1944. The silo then stood more or less as a ruin until it was rebuilt in 1946‑48, and then it was used a salt silo again until the 1980s. It then fell into disrepair due to lack of maintenance.

After the turn of the millennium, some of the local enthusiasts began to develop the idea of rebuilding the silo. They contacted the municipal council in 2002, and the vicar Ólavur Rasmussen became the prime mover in the project to completely renovate the silo and use it as a cultural centre. This became a reality with financial support from the Danish state, the Faroese Løgting, A.P. Møller Foundation and the municipality, and the construction process began in 2013. The costs of completely renovating the building amounted to about DKK 80 million.

All the main features of the original architecture have been preserved. On the original silo, SALT had been written on the roof in large, white letters. The new cultural centre has kept the name, but now composed of Sound Art & Live Theatre – SALT. The first major event took place in May 2017 and since then, the cultural centre has been used for a large number of events. The amateur theatre association Suðuroyar Sjónleikarfelag has SALT as its base.

Health and care on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	The white building to the right in the picture is the oldest part of Landssjúkrahúsið (the National Hospital of the Faroe Islands) from 1924. The green building in the middle is from 1968, and the grey to the left is from 2004. The most recent extension can be seen in the background of the picture. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 The state of health in the Faroe Islands is generally good. Life expectancy and the fertility rate are among the highest in the Nordic region, and while alcohol consumption has historically been – and continues to be – modest, the previously relatively high number of smokers is on the decline. However, signs are seen of a certain degree of poor mental well-being among young people, and the reasons for this are yet to be found. There are three hospitals located in the northern, central and southern parts of the country as well as general practitioners and dentists distributed throughout the country. And the current challenge of recruiting doctors is expected to improve in the near future.





Organisation and resources in the healthcare system


The Faroese Government is responsible for the dimensioning, operation and financing of the healthcare system in collaboration with the municipalities. There are three hospitals in Tórshavn, Klaksvík and Tvøroyri, respectively. The National Hospital in Tórshavn is the main hospital with wards for medical, surgical and psychiatric patients. In addition, there are outpatient clinics for eye diseases, ear-nose-throat diseases, skin diseases and neurological diseases. Apart from brain surgery and thoracic surgery, most specialties are practiced within the Faroese hospital system. Most positions are filled by Faroese specialists, while others are undertaken by visiting specialists, especially from Denmark. The hospitals in Klaksvík and Tvøroyri are smaller.

The National Hospital has undergone expansion for the past several years, and a new psychiatric ward has almost been completed. The total bed capacity has been reduced in recent decades in favour of shorter admission and increased outpatient diagnostics and treatment. In the event that more specialised assessment and/or treatment are needed, patients are referred to foreign hospitals, primarily to Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, which also has a special patient hotel for patients from the Faroe Islands.

The first case of COVID-19 infection was detected on 3 March 2020. Abundant and easily accessible testing capacity with quick responses, quarantine for all infected people and their close contacts as well as mandatory testing at the national border resulted in a low number of infections and a largely normal functioning society. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN The general practitioners, called municipal doctors, are distributed throughout the country and work either alone or in medical centres. They are public employees, but most of their salaries are based on income from individual benefits paid by public health insurance. The Faroe Islands is rated for 34 municipal doctors, but some of the positions are filled with temporary employees. The doctors have the opportunity to refer patients for treatment in the hospital system, but also to psychologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dietitians in private practice.

General dental care is private, but children’s dental care is municipal and free. There are a total of 51 dentists, some of whom work exclusively in children’s dentistry. School dental care began in the late 1950s and has gradually spread throughout the country, and the dental status of the children is generally good. Dental services are partly paid for by citizens and partly by a subsidy from public health insurance.

The total public expenditure on the healthcare system in 2020 was just under DKK 1.4 billion, corresponding to about 7 % of GDP. The total number of doctors, especially specialists, seen in relation to the size of the population is lower than in Denmark, which is due to recruitment problems. However, this is expected to become less of a problem in the future, as many young Faroese are training to become doctors.





Organisation of care and resources in the sector


Social services are mainly a national task with some areas assigned to the municipal sector. The nationwide social administration is managed by a national board of social services under the Faroese Government’s Ministry of Social Affairs. The national board of social services manages legal matters with regard to social security benefits as well as institutions and services within special care, consisting of accommodation and treatment facilities, personal support as well as sheltered homes and workshops. Social legislation in the Faroe Islands has been developed on the basis of the Danish legislation, and the areas of law and administration have gradually been taken over from Danish authorities and adapted to Faroese conditions. The pension legislation guarantees all citizens from the age of 67 a state pension, which amounts to DKK 8,240 per month for singles and DKK 6,371 per person for married couples. Furthermore, a labour market supplementary pension scheme was established in 1991, which in 1997 started paying benefits to people aged 67 and over. In 2020, the amount was DKK 5,740 per month.

In addition, the legislation ensures that all citizens who, due to illness or other circumstances, do not have an income receive a basic allowance. It is the National Board of Social Services that administers rehabilitation as well as job activation and wage subsidies for re-training schemes. Schemes involving job activation and wage subsidies are mainly used in collaboration with the general business community, but there is also an independent rehabilitation centre, through which work ability testing can be mediated. In addition, the National Board of Social Services administers disability and health-related early retirement pension, which still has three levels: lowest, middle and highest pension.

At the beginning of 2020, the group of people in job activation and wage subsidy schemes made up 3 % of the total workforce between the ages of 18 and 67. By comparison, the share of disability and health-related early pensioners was about 6 % of the adult population between 18 and 67 years of age. As for the elderly over the state pension age, the group made up 8 % of the total population.

It is the municipalities that are responsible for the elderly care, including nursing homes and home care. Some municipalities handle this task alone, while others, especially small municipalities, form part of communities to solve the tasks. The municipalities are also responsible for children’s institutions, i.e. nurseries, kindergartens and pre-school classes. Likewise, child welfare is outsourced to municipal administration through local child welfare services, brought together under a central child welfare institution. In cooperation between the national authorities, the administrative officer and the association of municipalities, an orphanage has been set up according to a similar scheme as in Denmark. It is the child welfare institution that manages the orphanage. Institutional services for children and young people and family centres, on the other hand, are managed by the social services.

The social services also manage financial support schemes for child support, child allowance and family allowance for families in financial need. It is also the social services that administer support for adoption payments, which are the highest in the Nordic region.

Within the social sector, direct financial support is provided to disability organisations and organisations for the elderly and the visually and hearing impaired. The same applies to organisations that work for the rights of children and young people, a shelter for people with mental illnesses and a crisis centre for abused women.

In 2020, the Faroese Government’s annual expenditure on social services was DKK 1.7 billion, and the municipalities’ expenditure on elderly care and primary health services was DKK 700 million, while the expenditure on children and young people amounted to almost DKK 600 million.





State of health


Life expectancy when a child is born is 85.3 years for girls and 80.4 years for boys, or 82.7 years for both sexes. Women thus have the longest life expectancy in the Nordic region and generally tops the population in the EU. The fertility rate is also the highest in the Nordic region with 2.4 children per woman. Perinatal mortality (stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life) is low; about five per 1,000 births, which corresponds to the rest of the Nordic region. Almost all births take place in a hospital. There is no free abortion, but abortion can be performed on medical indication. The number of induced abortions is therefore low and stands at about 20 % of the abortion rate in Denmark (about 50 per 1,000 live births).

Around a quarter of the causes of death can be attributed to cardiovascular diseases and another quarter to cancer. The rest of the causes of death are mainly infectious diseases, neurological diseases, lung diseases and accidents. In this distribution, the Faroe Islands are similar to the rest of the Nordic region. Fatal accidents, incl. road traffic accidents, have been around ten a year. Suicides are rare and have been around two per year in recent years.

The incidence of disease is broadly the same as in the rest of the Nordic region, however, the frequency of inflammatory bowel diseases is higher in the Faroe Islands compared to the other European countries, and the trend is increasing. Parkinson’s disease is also more common than in other Nordic countries. The diabetes frequency roughly corresponds to the frequency in Denmark, namely 6 % type 2 diabetes and 0.7 % type 1 diabetes. The incidence of cancer and the distribution of forms of cancer do not differ significantly from the rest of the Nordic region. The sexually transmitted diseases syphilis and gonorrhoea have become extremely rare in recent decades, as have HIV infections.





Prevention and health promotion


The Faroe Islands’ alcohol history differs significantly from that of the other Nordic countries. Serving and selling alcohol was banned in the period 1907‑92, and the ban was replaced by a system of public monopoly shops for the sale of alcohol as is known from the other Nordic countries apart from Denmark. Today, as a result of this system, the annual alcohol consumption per person over 15 is at the same level as in 1992, about six litres per year. This means that the Faroe Islands have managed to meet the objective of the legislative amendment, namely that liberalisation should not lead to an increase in consumption. However, questionnaires among 9th graders show that 13 % have been drunk in the past month and the trend is increasing.

In the public statistics, alcohol-related injuries are not prevalent. There are relatively few examples of cirrhosis or other known consequences of excessive alcohol consumption. There is, however, a significant number of citizens with problematic alcohol consumption. Two institutions for the treatment of alcohol addiction are run with public support, Blue Cross, which is based on a Christian foundation, and Heilbrigdið, which is based on the Minnesota principles.

Since World War II, smoking has been common among both men and women, incl. teenagers. For the past 25 years, however, the authorities have warned against smoking in campaigns, especially among primary school pupils. This has resulted in the number of smokers in 9th grade falling drastically over the past 30 years: Where the proportion of smokers among pupils in the 9th grade in 1989 was 30 %, it is now down to 7 %. The proportion of adults who smoke on a daily basis is 19 %, halving over the last two decades.

Drug consumption has been relatively modest, which is obviously due to the location of the islands and the relatively few access routes. This has allowed effective control at the national border.

The Faroe Islands, like major parts of the world, have an overweight problem. A good 60 % of the adult population is overweight (BMI over 25), which is higher than in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and almost on a par with Iceland. Particularly the men suffer from being overweight, but the trend is also seen among women, especially among the young.

The Faroese is at roughly the same level as the rest of the Nordic region as regards physical activity/inactivity. There are many sports activities, and a large part of the population are active sportspeople, both in team sports and individually. Nevertheless, about 30 % of adults do not meet the minimum recommendations from the WHO for physical activity.

Questionnaire surveys indicate that a part of the youth is unhappy. Whether this dissatisfaction is a new or old phenomenon is not known. The reasons are not clear either.

Government and constitution on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Procession in Tórshavn at ólavsøka on 29 July 2021. The members of the Løgting, members of the Faroese Government, the bishop, all the country’s vicars and the highest civil servants walk from the Løgting house to the cathedral. After a special service, they go back to the Løgting House, where the Prime Minister gives his opening speech. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS The large hall in the Nordic House in Tórshavn formed the setting for the final party leaders’ debate on 20 January 2004 before the upcoming general election. THOMAS BORBERG/RITZAU SCANPIX »The Faroe Islands are not a state, but a country with partial state quality.« This apt description by the Faroese politician and lawyer Edward Mitens was made in an exchange of views about the home rule in the Danish weekly law reports, Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen, in 1950, shortly after the home rule had come into force.

The Faroe Islands originally belonged to the Norwegian king. Over time, the Faroe Islands gradually became more closely associated with Denmark as the dominant of the two kingdoms in the dual Denmark-Norway monarchy in 1380‑1814. Regardless of actual association, the basis for the Faroe Islands’ international law affiliation with the Danish Realm should be found in article 4 of the peace treaty between Denmark and Sweden, signed in Kiel on 14 January 1814.





The Faroe Islands as part of the Danish Realm


However, the ultimate integration of the Faroe Islands into the Danish Realm did not happen until around the mid-1800s when Denmark adopted a democratic constitution. In contrast to the Danish counties, the Faroe Islands did not have an elected member in the Constituent Assembly of 1848‑49, but had a representative selected by the king. The Danish Constitution of 5 June 1849 was nevertheless proclaimed for the courts and put into force in the Faroe Islands between 1849 and 1850. It is unclear why the Faroese were not consulted on the matter, but it is often highlighted that, at the time, there was no public institution in the Faroe Islands to represent the views of the citizens. The Løgting was non-existent between 1816 and 1852, and there was no or only a weak public opinion.

Although the Danish Constitution had entered into force, the Faroese were not yet represented in the Danish parliament (the Rigsdag). In October 1850, the Danish minister for domestic affairs submitted a bill to the Danish Rigsdag for a separate act on Faroese representation in the Rigsdag. This bill caused a principled debate in the Danish Rigsdag about the position of the Faroe Islands in the Danish Realm. Leading figures such as A.S. Ørsted emphasised that the Faroe Islands, as an old autonomous legal jurisdiction, where first Norwegian and later Danish laws did not immediately become valid, should not be represented in the Danish Rigsdag without its inhabitants having had the opportunity to express themselves. Nevertheless, the bill was passed by a large majority in December 1850, after which the Faroe Islands were represented by two members, one for each of the two chambers of the Danish Rigsdag, the Folketing and the Landsting.

The Faroese Løgting was later restored in March 1852 and given the status of a county council, but with some far-reaching tasks, such as advisory assistance in the exercise of legislative power and the right to submit bills to the Rigsdag via the Danish Government.





Steps towards secession from Denmark


Opening of the Løgting in 1968. On the far left stands author and politician Karsten Hoydal. Number two from the left is the director and founder of Tórshavn Shipyard, Kjartan Mohr, who later became a politician and in 1958 founded the party Føroya Framburdsflokkur. On the far right is the later prime minister Christian Djurhuus. LEIF ANDERSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX World War II led to a political separation of Denmark and the Faroe Islands with Germany’s occupation of Denmark and Great Britain’s occupation of the Faroe Islands. In the period 1940‑45, the Faroe Islands governed themselves de facto according to a temporary form of government where the legislative authority was shared between the Løgting and the chief administrative officer as the representative of the Danish Realm. The separation changed the Faroese attitude to the affiliation with the Danish Realm to such an extent that when ties were re-established in 1945 it was clear that changes had to be made.

Negotiations in Copenhagen from January to March 1946 between a delegation from the Løgting and the Danish Government did not lead to an agreement, so on 25 March 1946, the Danish Government presented a final proposal for a new system, which the Faroese Løgting chose to submit to the Faroese voters in a referendum on 14 September 1946. The theme of the referendum was formulated as either secession from Denmark or acceptance of the Danish Government’s proposal. The proposal for secession won a narrow majority with 5,660 votes, corresponding to 50.7 % of the valid votes, while the Danish Government’s proposal received 5,499 votes, corresponding to 49.3 %. The turnout was 67.5 %, 4.1 % of the votes were invalid.

Initial reactions in Denmark after the referendum was that the result should be respected, or that it was up to the Faroese Løgting to interpret the result itself. This perspective of the Danish prime minister and other leading Danish politicians changed in line with an increasingly conflicted development in the Løgting in the following days, and on 25 September 1946 the king (actually the Danish Government) dissolved the Løgting and called a new election. After the early election to the Løgting on 8 November 1946, the supporters of independence were in the minority in the Løgting. New negotiations were then initiated between the Danish Government and the newly elected Løgting on a future Faroese home rule.





The Home Rule Act


The Løgting building in Tórshavn. In the background is the county administrative officer’s residence called Amtmansborgin or Borgin (Fortress), which was Tórshavn’s largest house in the early 1900s. LØGTINGIÐ, 1906 The result of the new negotiations was the Faroese Home Rule Act of 23 March 1948, which, after adoption by the Danish Rigsdag and the Faroese Løgting, entered into force on the 1st of April the same year.

Election posters hung in Tórshavn in the run-up to the general election on 31 August 2019, where nine parties were on the ballot. TRÓNDUR DALSGARÐ/RITZAU SCANPIX The Home Rule Act remained in force unchanged until 2005, when it was de facto amended by Act No. 578 of 24 June 2005 on the Faroese Authorities’ Takeover of Affairs and Fields of Affairs (the Assumption Act) and Act No. 579 of 24th of June 2005 on the Conclusion of Agreements under International Law by the Government of the Faroes (the Foreign Policy Act). The Home Rule Act, however, remains in force unless otherwise expressly amended.

The new acts from 2005 should be seen in the light of the fact that, in 2000, the Faroese Government had negotiated with the Danish Government to establish an independent Faroese state, however, the negotiations had been futile. The 2005 acts can thus be seen as a kind of reconstruction of conditions.

In essence, the home rule system entails that the home rule holds the legislative and administrative authority in special affairs, while the central authorities of the Realm have the authority within policy areas that do not belong to the Faroese home rule, either as permanent affairs of joint interest, or because the Faroese home rule has not yet taken over these policy areas.

The new chief administrative officer’s residence was designed by H.C. Amberg and built of Faroese basalt in 1881. Since the Home Rule Act of 1948, the building has been the residence and administration building of the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands. Photo from around the 1920s. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK The Home Rule Act divided the different policy areas into a list A and a list B. According to section 2 of the act, affairs enumerated on list A were to be regarded, in principle, as special Faroese affairs, which both the home rule and the central authorities of the Realm could freely decide should be taken over. Under section 3 of the act, negotiations with the central authorities of the Realm were to determine whether and to what extent the policy areas enumerated on list B should be transferred as special Faroese affairs.

However, the distribution of authority between the home rule authorities and the central authorities of the Realm was significantly changed with the 2005 Assumption Act, where the double positive list was turned upside down. Subject to section 2(1) of the Assumption Act, the home rule may unilaterally determine when all affairs other than the permanent affairs of joint interest specified in section 1(2) of the act, can be transferred as a special affair. According to section 1(2) permanent affairs of joint interest are 1) The Constitution, 2) Citizenship, 3) The Supreme Court, 4) Foreign, security and defence policy and 5) Foreign exchange and monetary policy.

The formal starting point for the Kingdom of Denmark’s legislative authority in the Faroe Islands is that all acts of the Danish Parliamentary apply to the Faroe Islands, unless a reservation has been made in an act that it does not apply to the Faroe Islands. However, in areas which have been transferred to the home rule as special affairs, Danish legislation is interpreted in such a way that it does not apply to the Faroe Islands, even if no reservation has been made.

In reality, the consultation provision in section 7 of the Home Rule Act implies considerable Faroese independence in legislative affairs, also in affairs of joint interest. Proposals for acts which only concern the Faroe Islands must thus, according to the first sentence of section 7(1), be submitted to the home rule for consultation before they are tabled in the Danish Parliament. Similarly, acts that otherwise concern local Faroese matters, but which do not only concern the Faroe Islands, must, in accordance with the second sentence of section 7(1), be submitted to the home rule before they come into force in the Faroe Islands. In practice, the home rule has had almost all legislation that has been put into force in the Faroe Islands for consultation before it has entered into force in the Faroe Islands, also legislation in areas of law other than those covered by the consultation obligation in section 7.

If the home rule authorities want Danish legislation to apply in the Faroe Islands, the procedure under the Instrument of Government Act from 1995, sections 47 and 48, implies that the Løgting adopts a recommendation to the central authorities of the Realm about the intended regulation, following the same procedure as when adopting acts of the Faroese Parliament.

When an area is taken over as a special affair, it follows that the home rule also takes over the related expenses. However, section 9 of the Home Rule Act allows the home rule government, after further negotiations and within the framework of an act passed by the Danish Parliament, to take over the administration of affairs of joint interest, while the economic (from 1988 included in the block grant) and formal responsibility for the legislation remains with the Danish Realm.

The central authorities of the Realm have, as appears from the section 5(2) of the Home Rule Act, the authority in foreign affairs. However, according to section 8(3), the home rule has access to assert special Faroese interests in negotiations with foreign countries in trade and fisheries matters. In special Faroese cases, the central authorities of the Realm have also, subject to section 8(4), been able to authorise the home rule government to conduct direct negotiations with foreign countries, provided that a request has been made to this effect, that the negotiations are not in conflict with the interests of the Kingdom of Denmark, and that the Danish foreign service participates.

The foreign affairs area was also revised in 2005 with the previously mentioned Foreign Policy Act. The most significant change in relation to the Home Rule Act means that, under the Foreign Policy Act, the Faroese Government has the right to negotiate on behalf of the Realm, in contrast to before, where the Faroese Government could be authorised following a request with the participation of the foreign service.

Besides the above-mentioned acts, the Instrument of Government Act also has the potential to be among the laws that impact the Faroe Islands’ constitutional position in the Realm.

The Faroe Islands’ own administrative system is a matter specified on list A of the Home Rule Act and was taken over already in 1948. In accordance with this, an act was passed on the Faroe Islands’ administrative system in special Faroese affairs and a corresponding act on the administration of the Faroe Islands. These acts of 1948 were replaced in 1995 by the new comprehensive Instrument of Government Act.





Work on a Faroese Constitution


Session in the Løgting in 2020 in the modernised Løgting chamber. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS The Løgting House in Tórshavn, which today houses the Løgting chamber. The Løgting’s administration etc. is housed in the old, renovated telephone exchange, which was built together with the Løgting House. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 A Faroese constitution was part of the plan for an independent Faroese state, which the government coalition from May 1998 had on the table. A constitutional commission was set up early in 1999 charged with delivering a draft Faroese constitution by June 1st, 2000. For various reasons, this deadline could not be met, one being that Danish-Faroese independence negotiations in 2000 did not lead to any result. New deadlines were set and revised several times, and it was not until the 18th of December 2006 that the commission was able to submit a report with proposals for a Faroese constitution. By this time, plans for Faroese independence had been shelved for the time being, and the constitution had to some extent been developed to also become a project for those who did not support the plans for full Faroese independence, but who believed that a constitution could nevertheless be useful.

The members of the Løgting outside the Løgting building wearing national costume at the opening of the Løgting in 2021. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS One of the key proposals in the report from 2006 was that the constitution should formulate what the Faroese people could reach agreement on in national terms, and that they should also reach agreement on procedures for what they could not agree on. It contained formulations such as »the Faroes and the Faroe Islands is one nation and one country«; the procedures that had to be followed if the Faroe Islands were to choose to become an independent state were therefore central.

However, the project stalled yet again in the period 2007‑10. However, a complete proposal for a Faroese constitution was presented to the Løgting in February 2010. In response to this, the Danish Ministry of Justice wrote a memo in June 2010 which questioned the proposal’s conformity with the Danish Constitution. After various attempts at presenting and representing the constitution, the project lost momentum yet again.

After being shelved in the period 2012‑15, the constitutional project was again given high priority in the government coalition between Tjóðveldi, Javnaðarflokkurin and the liberal party Framsókn in September 2015, and a proposal for a constitution was presented to the Løgting at the end of 2017. In its commencement provision, the proposal made a reference to the fact that the constitution would be administered in accordance with the existing constitutional scheme as long as a decision had not been made to establish the Faroe Islands as an independent state. This reference seems to have given the authorities assurance that the proposal for a constitution could not be interpreted as a kind of secession from the Realm.

The proposal was later referred to an ad hoc committee in the Løgting where it had to be reviewed and prepared for a referendum, which was to take place on the 25th of April 2018. However, the timetable could not be kept, the proposal lost momentum again and it has not since been revived.

The now shelved Faroese constitutional work illustrates that the Faroese constitutional position in the Danish Realm is a complicated subject which involves many different laws of a constitutional nature and also competing narratives and interpretations, both internally in the Faroe Islands and between Denmark and the Faroe Islands.

Education and research on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	Skúlin á Fløtum is designed by ZETA Arkitektar in collaboration with Brim Arkitektar and Árni Winther Arkitektar. With around 900 pupils, it is the largest primary school in the Faroe Islands. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 Right up until the 1990s, young people mostly went to primary school in their hometown, after which many moved to Tórshavn to take a secondary education. After that, it was necessary for most to move abroad, mainly to Denmark, to take a higher education. A large proportion of these students never moved back home again.

In the last 20 years, however, significant development has been seen in the field of education. More educational programmes and better facilities have been provided, and many new school buildings have been constructed. In 2020 alone, three new primary schools were inaugurated, and in the 2021/2022 school year, Skúlin á Fløtum in Tórshavn had 873 pupils, á Skúlatrøð in Klaksvík 707 pupils and Skúlin við Streymin in Oyrarbakki had 222 pupils.

Fróðskaparsetur Føroya (University of the Faroe Islands) has expanded its educational programmes since 2008, which has increased the number of students in the Faroe Islands, while the number of Faroese students abroad has stagnated. In 2019, for the first time, there were more Faroese students in the Faroe Islands than there were in Denmark.

In 2018, all youth education programs in Tórshavn were merged into Glasir – Tórshavn College, which has over 1,500 students and 250 employees. Glasir moved into a new shared building designed by the architectural firm BIG – Bjarke Ingels Group. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2022 The language of instruction is Faroese throughout the education system. Books and other teaching material for primary schools are produced by the publishing house Nám, which also publishes some for upper secondary education.

At the university, some courses are taught in English. This is partly because the teachers are of foreign origin and do not speak Faroese, and partly because there is an increasing need to offer selected courses and educational programmes in English.

In 1988, the Faroe Islands established an independent educational support system administered by Stuðulsstovnurin, from 2010 called Studni. Students in secondary education and higher education can get scholarships and loans. As Danish citizens, Faroese students are entitled to support under the Danish State Grant and Loan Scheme in Denmark and in other countries. In addition, they can get an annual travel grant from Studni. As non-EU citizens, students who want to study outside the Nordic countries pay a higher tuition fee than Danish students. Studni can provide support for part of this tuition fee. All schools and educational institutions fall within Uttanríkis- og mentamálaráðið (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Culture), which includes education, research, culture and, since 2019, also foreign affairs. In 2018, the Undirvísingarstýrið (Department of Education) was established under the Uttanríkis- og mentamálaðiráð. The department has administrative responsibility for the primary school and parts of the youth education programmes. In addition, Studni, Musikskúlaskipanin and Yrkisdepilin are also part of the department.

Primary school


Primary school is compulsory from 1st to 9th grade, while 10th grade is offered to all pupils. Pre-school classes can be established as an offer upon application from municipalities, and they are found especially in the large schools. In 2021, there were about 40 schools whose number of pupils ranged from one to 850. There is a total of around 7,000 pupils in primary school, including private independent schools and special school offers.

Primary school is regulated by law from 1997. Undirvísingarstýrið has the financial responsibility for school managers and teachers, while the municipalities have responsibility for school buildings, other employees and operating expenses. Traditionally, there have been schools in all villages and towns. In line with greater demands on schools and teaching as well as good infrastructure, several small schools have been closed down. Several small schools today have 1st-7th grade, while the oldest pupils take 8th-10th grade at a larger school. The trend towards larger school units has been particularly evident in the last ten years.

There are special educational offers at most medium-sized and large schools with professional support from Sernám. Skúlin á Trøðni has special education for students aged 7‑18 from all over the country.

There are a few private independent schools, and they are regulated by the act on private independent schools from 2002.





Youth education programmes


Fróðskaparsetur Føroya (University of the Faroe Islands) was established as an academy in 1965. In 1987, the institution acquired university status. Efforts are being made to group all faculties in the area around Debesartrøð where the university has its origins. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 Upper secondary and vocational programmes are offered in Klaksvík, Kambsdal, Vestmanna, Tórshavn and Hov. In addition to several upper secondary schools and higher preparatory examination (HF), a number of vocational programmes are offered in technology, construction, transport, office, trade, finance, food, service and health. A special music line is also offered in preparation for the music conservatory.

Tórshavnar Musikskúli was designed by Kontrast as lead consultant and was completed in 2018. Astri Luihn has been in charge of the artistic decoration. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 Upper secondary education with a view to the upper-secondary school leaving examination started when in 1937, the Løgting established a two-year upper secondary course in Tórshavn, which was changed to a three-year upper secondary education in 1959. After 25 years in temporary premises in the town, the new high school moved to Hoydalar in 1962, where the old tuberculosis sanatorium, together with a new school building that was put into use in 1963, became the setting for the high school Studentaskúlin í Hoydølum. From 1974, it also became possible to take higher preparatory examination (HF), and the school changed its name to Føroya Studentaskúli og HF-skeið.

The theoretical part of the apprenticeship programmes started in 1935 as evening classes, but from 1960 it was changed to day classes at the two technical colleges in Tórshavn and Klaksvík. Both colleges had boarding houses. Føroya Handilsskúli (Faroe Islands Business College) was established in 1967 and got new premises on the outskirts of Tórshavn in 1984. In addition to the more practical business education programmes, it is also possible to complete an upper secondary business education.

After a long period of political consideration, it was decided in 2013 to bring together the theoretical part of apprenticeship programmes and the various upper secondary educations in one and the same educational institution, Glasir – Tórshavn College, which also offers higher vocational education in collaboration with CBS in Copenhagen.

Number of students in youth education programmes and higher education in the 2021/22 school year. UNDIRVÍSINGARSTÝRIÐ AND FRÓÐSKAPARSETUR FØROYA, 2022 Shorter educational courses are available in the form of continuation schools, public folk high schools and home economics schools. There are 14 music schools in the music school system, which offer lessons for children and young people up to 25 years of age.





Higher education


Fróðskaparsetur Føroya is the Faroe Islands’ only university. In 2008, Fróðskaparsetur Føroya, Læraraskúlin (Teachers’ School, which has existed since 1870 and has also trained social education workers since 1990) and Sjúkrarøktarfrøðiskúlin (Nursing School established in 1960) merged into one institution with five faculties with research and researchbased education at bachelor’s and master’s level, in addition to individually tailored PhD programmes. In addition, minor subjects are offered in individual subject areas as well as a number of individual courses and continuing education. It has about. 1,000 students and 150 employed man-years.

Glasir offers a number of academy profession and diploma programmes, some of which in collaboration with foreign institutions.





Research


Researchers were far between in the Faroe Islands until the second half of the 20th century. Prospectus of Koltur from the collector and linguist J.C. Svabo’s work Indberetninger, indhentede paa en allernaadigst befalet, Reise i Færøe i Aarene 1781 og 1782 (Reports collected on a most graciously ordered travel in the Faroe Islands in the years 1781 and 1782). ROYAL DANISH LIBRARY Research is currently being carried out in a number of institutions and companies. The focus is particularly on marine research, aquaculture and health, but research is also carried out in other areas such as social science, humanities, environment and resources.

Havstovan is the largest sector research institution with a strong marine research environment and international network. It has participated in large European projects for many years. Fiskaaling is organised as a limited liability company and works closely with the aquaculture industry on research projects.

Deildin fyri Arbeiðs- og Almannaheilsu is the leading research institution in the field of health with a longstanding focus on the health effects of pollution in the sea on children and young people. Most of the research is financed via project grants. With the FarGen project, Ílegusavnið is building a national genetic infrastructure. Landssjúkrahúsið has a number of research projects, most of which are PhD projects. Since 2016, the institutions have gathered research in the health field in a centre under the leadership of Fróðskaparsetur Føroya.

Fróðskaparsetur Føroya is the largest research institution with the broadest research portfolio. Most resources is used in the field of education, but in recent years there has been an increased focus on research in selected areas.

In addition to these, the following sector research institutions exist: Jarðfeingi, Umhvørvisstovan, Heilsufrøðiliga Starvsstovan, Búnaðarstovan, Tjóðsavnið, Tjóðskjalasavnið and Landsbókasavnið. The university cooperates with the other institutions on both education and research.

Since 1996, the university has educated PhD candidates in several areas. Some are employed at the university, while others work in research institutions and companies and are enrolled at the university. Several Faroese PhD candidates are also enrolled at foreign universities, especially in Denmark, Norway and the UK. Some of these work at Faroese institutions and companies during the PhD programme. Until 1996, more than 30 Faroese had defended their Ph.D. or other obtained another doctoral degree. Since then, the number has increased to about 250, corresponding to 10‑15 new candidates annually.





Research councils and research and innovation funds


27-year-old Helma Maria Tróndheim is a good example of the development within the area of education and research. She went to primary school in her home town of Leirvík and to a technical college in the neighbouring town of Klaksvík. After taking a bachelor’s degree at Fróðskaparsetur Føroya in Tórshavn, she took a two-year master’s degree in Denmark. Today, she has returned to the Faroe Islands where she is working on a business PhD at the energy producer SEV in collaboration with Aalborg University and Fróðskaparsetur Føroya. She lives in Leirvík and commutes to Tórshavn. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2022 A new act on advice and support for research and innovation entered into force on 1 January 2021. The act introduced a national strategic council for research and innovation, set new frameworks for funds for research and innovation and strengthened coordination of national and international research collaboration.

The Granskingarráðið (Research Council Faroe Islands) was established as an advisory body in 1996. In 2002, the Granskingarráði became independent and annually distributes an average of DKK 7.5 million for research projects with relevance for the country. Particular priority is given to PhD projects. The Granskingarráðið has also managed other research pools, most recently DKK 25 million from the Danish Finance Act for marine research in the North Atlantic.

In 2001, Fiskivinnuroyndir (Fisheries Research Fund of the Faroe Islands) was established with funds for distribution in the fisheries area. These are mainly distributed to development projects, but also to research projects. The appropriation has varied quite a bit and is now DKK 6.5 million annually. In 2017, a fisheries fund was established, and DKK 13.5 million was injected as base capital. For now, the fund is not active.

Vinnuframagrunnurin (later Vinnuframi, fund for promotion of trade and industry) was established in 2001. One of its main tasks is to distribute funds for industrial innovation projects.

In 2014, the Granskingarráðið was given DKK 28 million by law from the private health funds which had been closed a few years earlier. Just under DKK 20 million was distributed in the period 2014‑20 to research projects and smaller projects in the health field. DKK 8.5 million was granted for a Centre for Health Research under Fróðskaparsetur Føroya with researchers from Fróðskaparsetur Føroya, Deildin fyri Arbeiðs- og Almannaheilsu, Landssjúkrahúsið and later Ílegusavnið.





International collaboration


Jákup Sverri is built at MEST shipyard (the hull in Lithuania) and is packed with equipment for marine research and population estimation. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS Traditionally, Faroese researchers have collaborated with researchers in not only the Nordic countries, but also in the rest of Europe and the USA. Most have completed all or part of their studies abroad and therefore have a strong international network. In recent years, international collaboration has been strengthened significantly through the Faroe Islands’ participation in European research and innovation partnerships. In 2010, the EU and the Faroe Islands entered into a bilateral agreement on participation in the seventh framework programme FP7. In 2014, an agreement was reached on continued participation in Horizon 2020. At the beginning of 2021, the new seven-year programme Horizon Europe took effect, in which the Faroe Islands also participate. Several institutions and companies have participated in projects with funding from the EU research collaboration.





Research infrastructure


Over time, the research institutions have each built up infrastructures for the respective research areas. This includes e.g. archives and collections of documents, samples, objects and images, health cohorts, a range of thematic databases and laboratory equipment.

The trawler Magnus Heinason, built in 1978, was converted into a marine research vessel in 1981 and was in operation until the end of 2020. It was replaced by Jákup Sverri, which is the first ship built for marine research around the Faroe Islands.

In 2009, the iNOVA research park was established in a disused industrial building. It has laboratory and office facilities for research and innovation. The funds for conversion and establishment came from Vinnuframi. iNOVA is run as a limited liability company, owned by public and private actors.

	 	 The Veltan community is the result of a development plan where agriculture and local enthusiasts have teamed up to grow vegetables under the motto ‘Sandoy – the green island’. Local food supply, quality and transparency in production are the cornerstones of the initiative.

In 2019, Veltan won the Nordic Food Awards, Embla, as a Nordic Food producer. Veltan is also behind the annual potato festival Eplafestivalurin held in Trøðum. Local products are presented and sold at the festival and cultural events take place.

In 2018, the public folk high school Mat og Moldmentanarháskúlin opened. The school is connected to Veltan (though organisationally independent) and focuses on soil, food, sustainability and culture. The original idea was that the public folk high school should be Veltan’s communicative element. In 2020, a folk high school association was established with the aim of supporting the folk high school and creating good connections between the students and between the school and the local community.

Wind Turbines on the Faroe Islands


trap.fo



	 	 With a battery system specially developed for the Faroe Islands’ electricity system, SEV’s wind farm in Húsahagi outside Tórshavn marked a significant step forward in the green transition. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 The Faroe Islands’ electricity production and energy consumption in 2020. 0.4 % of the electricity production is not indicated and comes from solar energy and biogas. UO03020 & UO03010 In 2020, diesel power stations accounted for 61.3 % of electricity production, while water and wind turbines accounted for 26.7 % and 11.6 %, respectively. However, the intermunicipal electricity company, SEV, has a goal that all electricity production must come from renewable energy sources by 2030, which will require a significant expansion of renewable energy. Wind turbines will probably play an important part in this respect, and a large number of wind turbines will therefore need to be erected on the islands before 2030.

Wind is a relatively constant factor in Faroe Islands and comes at quite high speeds, meaning that wind energy has great potential in electricity production, even if the steep mountains in several places present challenges in the form of turbulence. The location of the wind turbines is assessed based on the wind conditions, the infrastructure and the distribution grid. The planning will also need to take into account the nature values that might be affected by the wind turbines. For example, the wind turbines may be a challenge to bird life, which is disturbed by the noise, just as there is a risk of collisions with flying birds. The aesthetics must also be considered when placing the wind turbines, as must the fact that they can cause noise nuisances in, for example, nearby residential areas.

Before a licence can be given for establishing wind turbines, an environmental impact assessment must therefore be carried out to consider and assess all major consequences for the environment and nature. In this connection, the public and all relevant authorities and organisations will be involved. In addition, wind turbines must be given environmental approval which defines a threshold value for noise and shadow as well as requirements for self-monitoring and reporting.

Borðoy (Island)


trap.fo



	 	 With an area of 94.90 km², Borðoy is the largest island in Norðoyggjar. The mountain Lokki is 754 m high, but 600 meters to the north is the area’s highest point at 772 m. The island’s seven markatal settlements are Múli, Depil, Norðtoftir, Árnafjørður, Skálatoftir, Strond, Klaksvík and Norðoyri. Added to this there is the outlying village of Norðdepil, established in 1866, and Fossá, established in the 1860s and abandoned in 1953. The population trend on the island shows that the number of inhabitants in Klaksvík has grown very strongly, while it is in decline in the small villages further from Klaksvík.

Klaksvík (Town)


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Klaksvík is referred to as the fishing capital of the Faroe Islands. The end of Kunoy, Kunoyargalvur, stands as a landmark outside the entrance to the harbour, where extensive port facilities have been developed on both sides. On the right side of the port area, a new consumer cooperative (FK) has been built, and the town council house, a grey three-storey building, can also be seen. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2021 Klaksvík, previously called norðuri í Vági, has 4,992 inhabitants and covers 59 merkur and 12 gyllin. 47 merkur and 12 gyllin are copyhold land divided between nine copyhold tenants, and 12 merkur is freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 1,110 animals.

The town is located on and by a low eiðe (isthmus) between high mountains on both sides. On the coast to Borðoyarvík, moraine deposits from two ice advances have been found. Since 2007, the undersea Northern Isles Tunnel, Norðoyartunnilin, has connected Klaksvík with Leirvík on Eysturoy.

Excavations and ruins have also shown continuous settlement since the Viking Age. An overview from 1592 shows that Borðoy only had one church, and sources from 1669 state that the church was in Vági. This means that Klaksvík has been the main village on Borðoy for centuries.

The settlement is located in the only place on Norðoyggjar with a natural harbour, which is well protected by the island of Kunoy on the other side. However, this clear advantage was not exploited until fishing and ship fishing were developed during the 19th century. From 1801 to 1901, the population increased from 88 to 443 people.

A branch of the Royal Monopoly was established in Klaksvík in 1838, and with the introduction of free trade in 1856, the buildings were bought by J. Beck & Sønner, who began trading in the Faroe Islands. In 1912, Jógvan Frederik Kjølbro, who had worked at J. Beck & Sønner since 1902, began to carry on trade himself in the neighbourhood of Biskopstøð.

As a businessman, Jógvan Frederik Kjølbro was the most important profile in Klaksvík for several decades. As a member of the Brethren congregation, he also made a strong profile in the spiritual life, but involuntarily came into conflict with parts of the population during the medical dispute in the 1950s. In 2002, the town’s residents erected a sculpture of him by the artist Hans Pauli Olsen outside one of his businesses. CARLO RHIGER, 2018 Since then, Klaksvík has been the fishing capital of the Faroe Islands with a large and modern fishing industry at sea and on land, in addition to other secondary private and public businesses.

The hospital in Klaksvík was established in 1898 and has been expanded several times since then. In the turbulent years of the early 1950s, the hospital was involved in the famous conflict between parts of the local population concerning the doctor Olaf Halvorsen and the authorities in the Faroe Islands and in Denmark.

In 1917, the Brethren congregation established itself in Klaksvík. During the period 1920‑50, it gained such massive support that it includes 43 % of the inhabitants today. The reason is that Jógvan Frederik Kjølbro joined the Brethren congregation in 1920 and that Klaksvík were experiencing significant social changes during this period of break-up and large immigration. Furthermore, the traditional Evangelical Lutheran Church was weak in the village, and it did not establish itself with a resident vicar until 1934.

There has been a church in Klaksvík since 1592, possibly even earlier. The current church in Klaksvík, Christianskirkjan, is from 1963. When Norðoya Vestara Prestagjald was established as an independent parish in 1934, the vicar in Klaksvík was also responsible for the churches in Kunoy, Mikladalur, Húsum and from 1937 also the new church in Árnafjørður.

The Brethren congregation got its first meeting hall, Betesda, in 1917. In 2014, a new meeting hall of the same name was built. The Home Mission is housed in its own meeting hall from 1950, while another denomination, Kirkjuliga Missiónsfelagið, which established itself in Klaksvík with its own mission house in 1919‑20, got a new mission house in 2005. Several other small Christian congregations or communities were also established in Klaksvík, particularly after 1970.

Klaksvík is also known for a rich cultural life both in music and art. The groups Frændur and Hjarnar have released several records since the 1980s, and the town has hosted a recurring music festival for a number of years. The town’s artists include the graphic artist Elinborg Lützen, of whom a statue has been erected outside her childhood home.





Kjølbro and Klaksvík


When the merchant Jógvan Frederik Kjølbro had successfully established his trading and shipping business in Klaksvík in 1921, 4.9 % of the Faroese population lived in the town, and 6.6 % on the other Norðoyggjar. When the company had reached its peak at the time of his death in 1967, 11.6 % of the Faroe Islands’ population lived in Klaksvík, while only 2.6 % of the population now lived on the other Norðoyggjar. Since then, there have been no significant changes in the demographics.

Kjølbro’s importance can be seen directly from the fact that in 1933, he paid 14 % in municipal tax on a taxable income of DKK 132,000, corresponding to DKK 18,494. In the same year, Klaksvíkar Kommuna had a total municipal tax revenue of DKK 65,000. In 1937, four years later, Kjølbro paid DKK 800,000 in salaries to fishermen and workers. In the same year, the municipality’s tax revenue was based on a total of DKK 538,000.

Kjølbro’s companies, which ran into major financial problems during the 1960s, were too important to the overall Faroese economy to be allowed to go bankrupt. The state’s rescue operations resulted in the establishment of Føroyagrunnin in 1970, which still plays a significant role in the Faroese business community. The company J.F. Kjølbro’s still has significant activities in Klaksvík.

Føroya Bjór has been active as a brewery since 1888. In 2016, it expanded its business

to also produce gin, vodka and bitters, and since 2020, Einar’s Distillery has also produced its own whiskey. The distillery got new equipment in 2016, which can be seen in the photo. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS





Føroya Bjór – The local brewery


The Føroya Bjór brewery in Klaksvík was founded in 1888. For more than 100 years, there were two breweries in the Faroe Islands, Restorffs Bryggjarí in Tórshavn (Town) and Føroya Bjór in Klaksvík, competing for customers.

When the liquor prohibition act came into force in 1908, the two breweries only produced light lagers with a low alcohol content and a somewhat larger selection of soft drinks. In 1980, however, they were given permission to brew stronger beer.

After the Restorff brewery closed in 2007, Føroya Bjór dominated the market until a new brewery, Okkara, was established in 2010. However, Okkara, which still has its own production and beer profile, was taken over by Føroya Bjór in 2020.

With Einar’s Distillery, Føroya Bjór has since 2016 expanded its business with the production of vodka, gin and bitters, and since 2020 also its own whisky. Føroya Bjór is also the only company that produces a large range of soft drinks.





The accidents in Gerðum


In the late 1700s, the present Klaksvík area had four farms, Uppsalir and Vági to the west and Gerðum and Myrkjanoyri to the east. The farms were far apart, and there were uncultivated outfields between them. Together, the four farms housed 88 people and in 1765, 26 of them lived in two houses in Gerðum on the east side.

On the 12 of March 1745, an avalanche from the mountain buried houses and people in Gerðum in snow, and five people died. The houses were rebuilt in the same place, and when a new avalanche was triggered on the 12 of March 1765, these too were buried under a thick layer of snow; 20 of the total of 26 residents died. After this, it was decided to rebuild the houses in a safer place further down. Among the survivors was a single person who had also survived the first avalanche.

On the 12 of March 1910, another accident befell the residents of Gerðum. On this day, a rowing boat belonging to the farm was wrecked and six men drowned. As it happened, three major accidents hit Gerðum on the 12 of March.

Eysturoy (Island)


trap.fo





The southern part


The undersea tunnel, the Eysturoy Tunnel, was built in the period 2016‑1920 and is the Faroe Islands’ largest structure to date. It connects both sides of Skálafjørður on Eysturoy and Tórshavn on Streymoy. Tróndur Patursson created the artwork that was fitted around the tunnel’s roundabout. The chain of people holding each other’s hands gives associations to the traditional Faroese chain dance, but should, according to the artist, be understood as a broader portrait of Faroese unity as a prerequisite for the development of society. Eyðun Eliasen is the architect behind the portals and the light in the tunnel, which has several colours. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 With an area of 286.9 km², Eysturoy is the second largest island in the Faroe Islands. The island is connected to Streymoy by the bridge crossing the sound at Norðskáli. From here, the Norðskála Tunnel connects the western side of Eysturoy with the eastern side and further with the northern part of the island. A subsea tunnel, Norðoyatunnilin, from Leirvík to Klaksvík connects Eysturoy with Borðoy, and at the end of 2020, the subsea tunnel, Eysturoyartunnilin, from Tórshavn to Eysturoy was also opened. Inside the tunnel is a roundabout with exits to both Saltnes, Strendur and Tórshavn. Eysturoy has thus become a very central island. The roundabout, which is said to be the world’s first in an undersea tunnel, features a work of art by Tróndur Patursson.

The fjord lies on the southern side of the island, and on the eastern side lies Fuglafjørður, Gøtuvík and Leirvík where large port facilities have been built. It is not possible to build port facilities in the villages of Lamba, Rituvík and Æðuvík. The large companies are therefore concentrated in Skálafjørður, Fuglafjørður, Leirvík and Gøta as evinced by the local demographics. These villages have grown, while others have stagnated or simply serve as residential towns.

By Skálafjørður, the country’s longest fjord, the highest points are the mountains Støðlafjall and Stórafjall at 517 m and 567 m, respectively. Skálafjørður was previously called Kongshavn, where the municipalities since 1914 have been collaborating in respect of port of Kongshavnar based on a distribution key on rights, responsibilities and income for the individual municipalities.

Map of the districts and municipalities. KF.FO OG PEDER DAM, 2022. The markatal settlements of Strendur, Skáli, Søldarfjørður, Glyvrar, Toftir and Nes are located by Skálafjørður. The area also includes the outlying villages of Runavík and Saltangará, which have merged together with Glyvrar, Lambareiði, Gøtueiði and Skipanes.

The Faroe Island’s fourth largest lake, Toftavatn, is located in the border area between Glyvrar and Toftir. The flat heather-covered area around Toftavatn has a rich bird life. In this area, Runavíkar and Nes Kommuna have together laid a footpath called Sóljuleiðir around large parts of Toftavatn. An ancient legend about Nykurin, the water horse or the nix, has been associated with the lake. The supernatural creature assumes various forms and attempts to lure the unsuspecting to touch its tail, after which they cannot escape and are dragged under the water and drowned.

On the west side towards Streymoy lies the markatal settlement of Selatrað and the two smaller outlying villages of Kolbeinagjógv and Morskranes.

Gøta’s settlement is located mainly on the east side at Gøtuvík in the form of the markatal settlements of Syðrugøta, Gøtugjógv and Norðragøta, but with the outlying village of Gøtueiði, it also extends towards Skálafjørður. The markatal settlements of Leirvík and Fuglafjørður are also located on the eastern side of the island.

The municipalities in the southern part of Eysturoy are Nes Kommuna, Runavíkar Kommuna, Eysturkommuna, Fuglafjarðar Kommuna and Sjóar Kommuna. The southern part of Eysturoy is divided into four superior parishes.





The northern part


The two highest mountains in the Faroe Islands, Slættaratindur at 880 m and Gráfelli at 857 m can be found in the northern part of Eysturoy. This is also where the lake Eiðisvatn lies. The east side of the mountain ridge between Funningsfjørður in the east and Sundini in the west is characterised by deep valleys, also called cirque valleys. Where these meet each other, mountain passes or narrow mountain crests form.

Streymoy and Eysturoy were connected by a bridge over the sound at the village of Norðskáli in 1973. At that time, there was a road connection from Norðskála to Eiði, Gjógv and Funningur, roads that had been built from the late 1950s to the early 1960s. There was no road connection between Eysturoy’s western and eastern side, it only came with the Norðskála Tunnel in 1976 and the road between Funningsbotnur and Funningur 1987. Before the roads were built, the villages could only be reached by sea. The improved infrastructure has had a major impact on the development of the area.

In the past, there were several small municipalities in the northern part of Eysturoy. Gjógv had been an independent municipality since 1948 and merged with Sunda Kommuna in 2005. The former independent municipalities of Funnings Kommuna, Elduvíkar Kommuna and Oyndarfjarðar Kommuna merged with Runavíkar Kommuna between 2005 and 2009. Eiðis Kommuna has been an independent municipality since 1884. Since 1944, it has consisted of the outlying villages of Ljósá and Svínáir. Today, the northern part of Eysturoy is divided into three superior parishes.

In 2021, the northern part of Eysturoy consisted of the following municipalities: Eiðis Kommuna, Runavíkar Kommuna and Sunda Kommuna. Several villages on the northern Streymoy also belong to Sunda Kommuna.

Eiði (Settlement) and Eiðis Municipality

	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Off the Kollurin peninsula at Eiði, two cliffs rise out into the sea. That is Risin and Kellingin (The Giant and the Witch). According to the legend, the two trolls tried to move the Faroe Islands to Iceland, but their venture failed because when the sun rose, they were turned into stone. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2009 Eiði, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 688 inhabitants, covers 48 merkur and is the largest markatal settlement on Eysturoy; 4 merkur are copyhold land and 44 merkur are freehold land. The copyhold land is owned by a single copyhold tenant.The sheep herd consists of 1,520 animals.

Eiði lies in a depression at the foot of the Eiðiskollur or Kollurin peninsula with access to the sea on both sides. The settlement extends up the south side of Kollurin.

Northwest of Eiði, off Kollurin, stand the two mighty sea stacks called Risin and Kellingin (the Giant and the Witch) at 71 and 69 m, respectively.

Since 1823, the 352-m high Eiðiskollur has been protected from sheep grazing in summer. That is one of the reasons for the area’s special flora, with plants such as mountain avens, golden cinquefoil and small white orchid (Pseudorchis albida). Bog bilberry grows in abundance and field gentian is much more common on Eiðiskollur than elsewhere in the Faroe Islands.

Population trends in Eiði 1966‑2021.

HAGSTOVA FØROYA Archaeological findings at Durhús, which is located in the middle of the village, dates the village to the Landnam period. At that time there was just one farm, Eiðisgarður, which was divided into two farms during the 11th century, after the shieling at Argisbrekka had been abolished.

Eiði is close to the Faroe Islands’ northern fishing banks and has always offered excellent fishing opportunities. Eiði therefore experienced considerable population growth in the 19th century, and in 1880, the village, with its 500 inhabitants, was the second largest in the country. Decline in local coastal fishing in the 1900s led to a fall in population, but it has since grown again.

Boats still come from other villages during the fishing season, and the village established a jetty and breakwater relatively early on, which have since been extended several times, so that the village now has a good port. The other small villages that belong to the municipality also have smaller ports. Relatively early, the village had a fish factory and several fishing ships. There are several companies in the municipality.

The power company SEV has since 1986 expanded its electricity production with a hydropower plant in Eiði by damming Eiðisvatn, from where tunnels have been drilled for water supply. There are also plans to establish a wind farm.

Since the very early days, the church and the cemetery have been placed in the middle of the village. A new church was built in 1881, designed in the Romanesque style by the Danish architect H.C. Amberg and is prominently placed at the highest point.

Eiði has had school teachers since 1834, and the first school building was built in 1874. The current school building was built in 1965. It was expanded with a sports hall in 2001, and in 2020, an 8.5-m climbing wall was added. The old gym was converted into a music school and cultural centre in 2016.

Senior co-housing was established in 1999, and a kindergarten opened in 2008.

A football stadium and a new village hall were built in 2018.

The distinctive house Látralonin was built in stone by the farmer Poul Joensen, called Pól á Látrinum, in 1841‑42. He accompanied the chief administrative officer, C. Pløyen, on the famous study trip to Shetland in 1839. The listed house now serves as the village’s local museum.

Since 2014, the municipality has organised an autumn festival, Heystfagnaðin, in October every year, where traditional Faroese village life is celebrated.

Hotel Eiði welcomed its first guests in 1983, but was closed in 2011, and the building now houses a rehab clinic for young people with alcohol and drug addiction.

Eiði Camping opened in 2015 on the village’s disused football field facing the sea.

In 1975, a memorial was erected to men who have died at sea, made by Fridtjof Joensen; the scene is a mother with her little son.

The artist Niels Andreas Kruse, who lived in Eiði, was a pioneer in Faroese landscape painting. His granddaughter, Sigrun Gunnarsdóttir, who has a studio in the village, is one of the Faroe Islands’ wellknown painters.

Dr. Rasmus K. Rasmussen was a doctor on the entire northern part of Eysturoy and the northern part of Streymoy. To get from Eiði to the other villages, he had to walk over the mountains and sail across fjords and sounds, often in bad weather. The photo shows Dr. Rasmussen (at the front) on his way from Eiði to Tjørnuvík on a sick visit. Behind the boat is Eiðiskollur on Eysturoy. Photo from 25 August 1947.

The municipal doctors in Eiði


In 1912, the first municipal doctor with a medical practice settled in Eiði. In 2017, the medical practice moved to a more central location in the medical district in the neighbouring village of Norðskála.

Over time, three municipal doctors in Eiði have distinguished themselves with more than just their medical practice: Rasmus K. Rasmussen, municipal doctor 1920‑52, made important observations regarding psittacosis or parrot fever, which was transmitted to humans via the northern fulmar. Along with other observations in his medical articles, including a work on Faroese traditional medicine, Gomul Føroysk Heimaráð (1959), this to his being appointed an honorary doctorate at the University of Copenhagen in 1950.

Petur Reinert, municipal doctor during the periods 1960‑75 and 1978‑86, distinguished himself as a local entrepreneur within the fishing industry. He was general manager of the fish filleting factory Norðís and shipowner from 1986, Minister for Fisheries and Municipalities 1975‑79 and member of the Løgting in the years 1980‑84, representing Tjóðveldisflokkurin (now Tjóðveldi).

Magnus á Stongum, municipal doctor 1986‑2008, is a well-known songwriter and singer, and he is a guitarist and singer in the band Tinganest. He also became an important figure in the local football club EB/Streymur.





Radar station and Loran station


In Kardemomme By, all the houses are black with white windows. The location is good in terms of weather and wind. Therefore, the football pitch is also very well located in the swampy terrain called Hólmin. The area was once a lake and was drained in 1924‑25. A part of Hólmin which is home to the stadium and kindergarten is a protected area and is of great importance for the birdlife, particularly waterfowl, in the area and for the lake further down. HANNA KRUSE MØLLER, 1964 On the mountain Eiðiskollur on Eysturoy, the British built a radar station during World War II. The radar system was one of the first developed by the British military and was therefore kept secret.

The construction provided work for some 100 men, and during the period 1942‑43, 30‑40 Royal Air Force soldiers were attached to the station until it was closed down. The ruins can still be seen.

On Suðuroy, at the 200 m high Eggjarnar, the British engineer corps built a Loran (Long Range Aid to Navigation) station, which was commissioned in October 1943 and manned by British Royal Air Force personnel. The navigation system was used by ships, submarines and airplanes. Denmark took over operation of the station in September 1946 and operated it until it was closed in December 1977. The buildings can still be seen.

In the area on the island of Eysturoy at Eiði and the former British radar station, a new Danish manned Loran-C facility was built in 1959‑60, initially for military use, including the American Polaris programme with nuclear-armed submarines in the North Atlantic. Satellite-based navigation systems later made the Loran-C system redundant, and the station with the 190.5 m high antenna mast was decommissioned in 2019. The seven black and white houses built for the staff at the lake Niðri á Vatn, the so-called Kardemomme By, are still standing and have now passed into private ownership.

On Sornfelli, just north of Tórshavn, a radar station was built in 1959‑62, manned by more than 100 people. The radar stations was supposed to warn of aircraft and rocket attacks from the Soviet Union. It was closed in 2007, and the building facilities were handed over to the Faroese Home Rule in 2013. In 2022, at Denmark’s request, the Home Rule Government agreed to the re-establishment of a new radar head for warning of potential aircraft and missile attacks at the same location.

Eiði, 2021. Although the village dates from the Viking Age, the oldest house is only from 1842. The old town is bordered by Lækjuvegur and Lágiryggur. The newest buildings are found after Gerðisvegur. Unlike the old town, the new buildings have a good view, but a lot of wind. The natural resort at á Barnalofti is also intended for development.

Fuglafjørður (Settlement) and Fuglafjarðar Municipality


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Fuglafjørður on the eastern side of Eysturoy covered in snow. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 Fuglafjørður, together with the outlying village of Hellur and Kambsdalur, constitutes Fuglafjarðar Kommuna.

The markatal settlement of Fuglafjørður, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 1,561 inhabitants and covers 32 merkur and 1 gyllin. 6 merkur are copyhold land, and 26 merkur and 1 gyllin are freehold land. The copyhold land is leased by one copyhold tenant. The sheep herd consists of 1,529 animals.

The village and the fjord lie well protected from most wind directions. It is surrounded by high mountains, the highest being the 737-m high Blábjørg to the west and the 626-m high Húsafelli to the east.

Like white cotton balls, the woolly seed pods of the common cotton sedge (Eriophorum angustifolium) rise above a damp depression at Fuglafjørður on Eysturoy. The distinctive and easily recognisable sedge is a common plant in Faroese fens, where it grows together with, e.g., bog moss and various species of sedge as well as deer’s grass, purple moor grass and bog asphodel. MARINE GASTINEAU/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2015 The village dates from the Viking Age where, at the outlet of the largest stream, there was also a landing site for ships and boats. In the mountains, you will find ruins of houses such as Uppi á Húsum where people sought refuge from pirates, and houses such as Eingilska hús, the English house, from which they kept a lookout for pirates.

The introduction of free trade in 1856 marked the arrival of more trading companies that bought fish to produce dried cod. The village’s first fishing vessel, Florence, was bought in Great Britain in 1892 by S.P. Petersen, who had set up as a merchant in 1887. He also owned most of the ships that arrived later. Fishing and fish production lead to a doubling of the population over a short period of time.

A landing site for large ships was built around 1910. After World War II and in the early 1950s, the port area was expanded considerably to be able to accommodate an increasing number of companies and can now accommodate many moored vessels. Both Faroese and foreign ships regularly call at the port with their catches or to bunker at the oil depot. There is also a port for small boats.

On land, there are production facilities for salmon fry, and on the fjord, there are facilities for salmon farming. A workshop makes fish feeding boats for both the local and the international market. The largest company is the fishmeal and salmon feed factory Havsbrún, which is owned by P/F Bakkafrost. Another company is Pelagos, which processes products from pelagic fish catches for export. In order to obtain adequate capacity of cold storage for the manufactured products, P/F Bergfrost has blasted a cavity in the mountain by the harbour. It has a freezing capacity of 30,000 tonnes.

Population trends in Fuglafjørður 1966‑2021.

HAGSTOVA FØROYA In 1984, the old stone church in Fuglafjørður from 1871 was replaced by a modern church with room for 460 people designed by the Danish architect Holger Jensen. A local builder, Sveinbjørn á Horni, was in charge of the construction. With its excellent acoustics and a 26-stop organ built by Marcussen & Søn, the church is an excellent venue for concerts.

The Thabor mission house was built in 1924. The Brethren congregation’s first meeting hall, Siloa, from 1924 was replaced by a new Siloa in 1992. After the old meeting hall was demolished, a statue of the Brethren preacher Victor Danielsen, who lived in Fuglafjørður, was erected on the site.

The village’s first school was built in 1882. A new one was built in 1936, and from 1958 you could take the qualifying examination. The school has since been expanded several times.

Fuglafjørður is known for having received many foreign fishing vessels already at the beginning of the 20th century, especially from Norway. Therefore, cultural influence from the outside came early in the village in the form of modern dancing and accordion music. The accordion has since been a popular instrument in Fuglafjørður, which also has its own brass band, bands and choirs as well as a theatre association.

A group of private individuals opened a library in 1954, which was taken over by the municipality in 1977. 2002 saw the opening of Mentanarhúsið, a cultural centre which offers a wide range of activities, often in collaboration with Nordens Hus in Tórshavn.

ÍF, Ítrótttarfelag Fuglafjarðar, founded in 1946, was originally a football and handball club, but is now an umbrella organisation for several sports. Fuglafjarðar Svimjiefelag, founded in 1975, and the gymnastics association Flog, founded in 1989, are independent associations. The YMCA and YWCA scouts have a clubhouse in Kambsdalur. The village has a household association, a pensioners’ association and Christian communities within the Brethren congregation and the Evangelical Lutheran Church.





Karvatoftir (Knarratoftir)


Fuglafjørður has a road called Knarratoftir. An old legend has it that Rádni oman Lon owned a knørr (cargo ship), which he sailed to Norway every year to sell his goods. In the winter he pulled up his ship at the place by the beach where he had a neyst or boathouse for his ship. The boathouse is gone, but the name still exists.





Border dispute


Sjúrðargøta is an old path which used to be the main road from Fuglafjørður to the villages on northern Eysturoy. On this path, a dispute about the yield arose between the farmer of Oyndarfjørður, Oyndri, and the farmer of Fuglafjørður, Gullbrandur, and Oyndri killed Gullbrandur with his spiked staff. He hid the body in a cave above Hellur, which is still known as Gullbranshellið, and the place where Gullbrandur was later buried can also still be seen. For his misdeed, Oyndri had to cede his half of the outfield that the two farmers had previously owned together to Fuglafjørður. Therefore, Fuglafjørður owns half of Oyndarfjørður all the way to Laksá, the salmon river, which has its outlet in the middle of the fjord bed.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Funningur is mentioned in both Hundabrævið as Funding and in Skipan um Tingfaratoll from around the year 1400 as I Funningi. The village currently has 45 inhabitants.

The village covers 15 merkur of land, of which 8 gyllin are copyhold land and 14 merkur and 8 are freehold land. The copyhold land is owned by a single copyhold tenant. The sheep herd consists of 874 animals.

West of the village lies the Faroe Islands’ highest mountain, the 880-m Slættaratindur. The village lies as a cluster of houses at the outlet of the stream Stórá. Several sites from older settlements have been identified. The village has a small jetty, and there is a road to Funningsfjørður and Eiði.

The church is a traditional black wooden church with a turf roof built in 1847 by the builder Jacob Andreassen from Syðrugøta. The school was built in 1948 based on drawings by H.C.W. Tórgarð. The village also has a village hall a dance room.

Gjógv (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Stórá, which divides Gjógv in two, has always been a popular playground for children. Rowing on rafts and in rubber boats in the small pond in the middle of the village is a very popular activity. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2021 Gjógv covers 15 merkur of freehold land is the northernmost village on Eysturoy. The sheep herd consists of 1,155 animals.

The village is located by a 200 m long gorge, which serves as a port for small boats, and was first mentioned in 1584. It is said that Gjógv is an early outlying village from Funningur, which in old documents is also referred to as Funnings Gjógv. The oldest settlement was at Eysturi við Garðar, where the church and cemetery are located today.

The stream Daláin or Stórá divides the village in two. The Ambadalur valley lies northwest of Gjógv, and on the coast rises the 188 m high, freestanding Búgvin sea-stack, where seabirds breed in large numbers. Southeast of Gjógv lies the mountain Tyril at 535 m and to the south lies Middagsfjall at 601 m. The infield in Gjógv is unusually large in comparison with the infield of many other villages.

A fisherman sorts his catch on the rocks in Gjógv, which is named after the deep gorge (gjógv) that cuts into the landscape at the village. The natural harbour is one of the Faroe Islands’ major tourist attractions. It was probably already used in the Viking Age. During World War II, new steps and a new house for the hoist were built. Photo from 1970. RIISBERG/RITZAU SCANPIX From Gjógv, it is a short sailing trip to the Djúpini sound, which is abundant in fish, and the village lies on the Norðhavet, where cod spawn in spring. The fact that all the land has been privately owned, as well as the short distance to fishing grounds, has contributed to the considerable population growth during the 19th century, particularly after the introduction of free trade in 1856. Besides boat fishing, many from Gjógv went out on fishing vessels from other parts of the Faroe Islands. A road connection to Eiði was established in 1959 and to Funningur in 1964.

The population peaked at 286 people around 1945, but the outward migration has been significant in recent years, and many of the houses are now empty most of the year and are mostly used as holiday homes. The new holiday home area, Fornagarður, has 19 holiday homes, and the Flatnagarður campsite was established in 2014. Gjógv currently has 24 permanent residents.

Gjógv’s first church was built in 1929, designed by the vicar Vilhelm Nielsen and placed so that it looks the best from the sea. At the consecration, the service was held in Faroese, which was the first time in Faroese church history. A sculpture by Fridtjof Joensen was erected opposite the church in 1971, depicting a mother and her two sons waiting for the man of the house to return from the sea.

The village’s first school was built in 1883, but is no longer in use. In the past, a large number of pupils from the school went on to take a higher education.

The village hall dates from 1956 and was restored in the late 1980s. It is still the venue for a range of activities.

The most important workplaces today are a precast concrete factory that opened in 1982 and a breeding centre for salmon fry from 1985. Due to a crisis in the industry, the breeding centre closed in 2004, but has since reopened under the Bakkafrost Group.

Tourism has become increasingly important, and the hotel Gjáargarður opened in 1984. The number of visitors is on average 35,000 per year.

The Norwegian TV series Buzz Aldrin, hvor ble det av deg i alt mylderet? (Buzz Aldrin, where did you end up in all the fuss?) (2011) largely takes place in Gjógv.

Gøtugjógv (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The altarpiece in Gøtu Kirkja in Gøtugjógv is a glass mosaic by visual artist Tróndur Patursson from 1995. JENS CHRISTIAN TOP/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2017 Gøtugjógv has 44 inhabitants and covers 6 merkur of copyhold land, which is divided between two copyhold tenants. The sheep herd consists of 100 animals.

The place is named after a gjógv (gorge). A farmer’s son from the farm Húsgarður in Syðrugøta moved here in the 17th century, and around the year 1800, the farm was divided into two farms. Later, more people settled in the area. When a bridge was built across the gorge in 1852, Gøtugjógv became the most central place in Gøta where the first school was built in 1890. A new school was built in 1929 and has later been expanded several times, most recently in 2010.

The Bethania mission house was built in 1924 but has been demolished, however, a new one is under construction. In the 1930s, the temperance movement built N.I.O.G.T. (Nordic Independent Order of Good Templars) Glottin. The Filadelfia hall of the Brethren congregation was also built in the village.

Gøtugjógv also has banks, a post office and shops, but future restructuring of the postal service may change this.

The new Gøtu Kirkja, which was built instead of the old church in Norðragøta, was completed in Gøtugjógv in 1995. The church, which was consecrated on 25 June that year in the presence of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Nordic bishops, is decorated with large stained glass paintings by Tróndur Patursson.

Gøta (Settlements)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Blásastova in Norðragøta is one of the many old houses around the country that have been converted into a local native museum. These museums and the surrounding buildings have been preserved as a significant cultural heritage at the initiative of the Gøtu Fornminnisfelag. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 Gøta, mentioned in Hundabrævið, is a collective name for the three markatal settlements of Norðragøta, Gøtugjógv and Syðrugøta, which face the Gøtuvík bay, as well as the outlying village Undir Gøtueiði at Skálafjørður. Together with Leirvík, they make up Eysturkommuna.

The altarpiece in Gøtu Kirkja in Gøtugjógv is a glass mosaic by visual artist Tróndur Patursson from 1995. JENS CHRISTIAN TOP/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2017 In Eysturkommuna, 1st to 3rd graders go to school in Leirvík, and 4th to 7th graders go to school in Gøtugjógv. After the 7th grade, the pupils continue in Fuglafjarðar skúli.

Like other large villages, Gøta has gone from being a farming community to a fishing community, but it also holds a special place in the oldest history of the Faroe Islands. The Viking Age chieftain Tróndur í Gøtu, who is one of the central figures in Færeyingasaga, lived here and had farms in both Syðrugøta and Norðragøta.

Today, Gøta is world-renowned for the annual G! Festival in July, where Faroese musicians are joined by musicians from all over the world. The festival takes place partly on the sandy beach in Syðrugøta, partly in elsewhere in Gøta.

The road connection from Gøta to Fuglafjørður was established around 1925 and, around 1935, the villages at Skálafjørður could also be reached by road.

In 2004, the nursing home Gøtubrá opened in Norðragøta with places for ten residents, plus six relief places.

The day-care facility Gjái, which can accommodate 80 children, is located in Gøtugjógv. It also serves as an after-school facility for children in the 1st and 2nd grade.

Gøta’s church has been located in Norðragøta for centuries. In 1995, a modern church was built in Gøtugjógv, which now serves as the parish church. However, the old church from 1833 is still used on special occasions. It is one of several preserved buildings, which the Gøtu Fornminnisfelag has preserved as a cultural-historical and unique museum environment from the 19th century.

Hellurnar (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur A motorboat has arrived at Hellurnar with salted cod from Fuglafjørður, which is unloaded to be washed and dried and then picked up again. The herring nets in the foreground show that herring fishing was also carried out with nets in the waters off the village. Photo from around 1930. SIGRID LÜTZEN The outlying village of Hellurnar, which today has 12 inhabitants, was established in 1849 by the fjord Oyndarfjørður that offered farming opportunities and lay a short distance away from the northern fishing grounds. Traces of early habitation can be found in the village, as indicated by the place name Havnarbøur. The shepherds used to have a house in the area, Topphús, where they could spend the night.

The merchant S.P. Petersen from Fuglafjørður established a trading branch in 1907, and in order to create local jobs, he had the salted cod transported to the village to be sundried into dried cod.

For many years, teaching took place in private living rooms six times a year, but in 1923, a school was built where an itinerant teacher taught every two weeks. The school has since closed and been converted into a house of prayer, which serves as both the village church and a village hall.

Marine Harvest has a salmon farm in the Oyndarfjørður fjord outside the village.

Kambsdalur (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Kambsdalur, named after the Kambur mountain, is the Faroe Islands’ youngest outlying village. Fuglafjørður has not much area to build on, and the Kambsdalur area south of the village has therefore been included for housing development. The YMCA and YWCA scouts had a clubhouse on the site, but the first real housing did not come until 1985. Kambsdalur also has an industrial area with workshops and companies which make hydraulic equipment and equipment for fishing and salmon farming.

After starting in the old school in Gøtugjógv in 1982, Studentaskúlin and HF-skeiðið í Eysturoy, i.e. the high school programme in Eysturoy, moved into a new school building in Kambsdalur in 1993. The same place as the local branch of Føroya Handilsskúli, which was both a business school in the traditional sense and a commercial college, and which had been there since 1989. The two schools merged in 2012 to become Miðnám á Kambsdali, which includes an ordinary high school, commercial college and a higher preparatory examination programme. Miðnám á Kambsdali mainly recruits students from Eysturoy and Norðoyggjar and also has a branch in Klaksvík.

Kambsdalur also has day-care facilities and reception classes.

Lamba (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The markatal settlement of Lamba, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 148 inhabitants and covers 29 merkur of copyhold land divided equally among four copyhold tenants. There is no freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 880 animals.

The village is located in a narrow green valley, through which the river Dalá runs. A landing site is located at the end of the stream, and boat houses stand on the beach hill. A large rock on the dock is said to be inhabited by supernatural beings and was therefore not moved when the landing site was built.

The ship Norske Løve, belonging to the Danish East India Company, stranded on New Year’s Eve in 1707 at Lamba, and the lives of around 100 sailors were saved. On the seabed, where the ship went down, you can still see copper plates and bright ballast stones, and the ballad Norske Løve is about that particular event. The ship’s bell and a model of the ship hang in the cathedral in Tórshavn.

Leirvík (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur In 1989, the intermunicipal company IRF built an incineration plant in Leirvík. Waste from the municipalities is transported to the plant where it is incinerated. The local company Faroe Marine Products utilises part of the waste heat from the incineration plant for drying fish products that are exported to Nigeria. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 Leirvík has 1,004 inhabitants and covers 32 merkur, 8 gyllin and 11 skinn. 27 merkur and 8 gyllin are copyhold land distributed between six copyhold tenants, and 5 merkur and 11 skins are freehold land. In addition to traditional sheep farming, the settlement also has a dairy producer. The sheep population consists of 700 animals.

Leirvík, which used to be an independent municipality, merged with Gøtu Kommuna in 2009 to become Eysturkommuna.

The village is located on the northern side of the Gøtunes peninsula at Leirvíksfjørður in a low coastal area surrounded by the mountains Ritafjall at 641 m, Knúkur at 463 m and Sigatindur at 612 m. The village was formerly divided into the three býlingar Toftanes, uttan Á and við Garð, which today constitute a coherent village. Archaeological investigations between 1982 and 2001 have documented a Viking Age farm in Toftanes dated to the 8th-10th century and a Viking Age settlement at Húsbak við Garð as well as another settlement from the 18th century in Toftanes.

Archaeological investigations were carried out between 1987 and 1999 in Uppistovubeitinum in connection with construction work, and several buildings were excavated which can be dated to the 12th-14th centuries. Leirvík has the Faroe Islands’ best-preserved prayer house ruin, Bønhústoftin, with cemetery walls from the Catholic period.

Leirvík had a permanent road along the coast around 1935. This unsafe road is now only open to light traffic and was replaced in 1985 by the 2,238-m long Leirvík Tunnel between Norðragøta and Leirvík. The 6,186-m undersea tunnel between Leirvík and Klaksvík, Norðoya Tunnel, was opened in 2006. An emergency station, which is crucial in connection with the undersea tunnel, was established in 2019.

The port has been expanded in stages with a quay facility for large ships at the end of World War II and a fishing port in 1973, where a car ferry berth was also established. However, this lost its usefulness after the establishment of the Norðoya Tunnel. The port was expanded again in 1985, and in 2012, also with a marina with space for 70‑80 boats.

The fish filleting factory Frost was established in the port area in 1957. It closed during the economic crisis in 1992, but reopened under the name Tavan, which today makes products from argentine, herring and mackerel. Faroe Marine Products has since 2001 been a pioneer in air-drying fish products such as fish heads, which are exported to, e.g., Nigeria, and utilising the waste heat from the incineration plant in Leirvík in its production. Fofish/Norðfra produces several fish products for the local market as well as for export, while Prima Fisk mainly produces for the local market.

In 1989, the waste management company IRF (Interkommunali Renovatiónsfelagsskapurin) built the Brennistøðin á Hagaleiti incineration plant in Leirvík. IRF receives waste from all municipalities except Tórshavnar Kommuna.

The church in Leirvík was built in 1906 by builder Johan Andreas Petersen from Mikladalur. The walls are built of stone, and the church bell is from the same year and cast by De Smithske Støberier in Aalborg, Denmark. In 1980, the church was expanded with a chapel and new tower, and also had a new altarpiece, painted by the local artist Jóannis Kristiansen. In 1988, the church had a new 17-stop organ built by Kristian Kruse. In 2003, the church was repainted by Tummas M. Smith.

Leirvíkar Missiónshús has been in the settlement since 1924. A new mission house with the same name opened in 1990. the Brethren congregation had its first assembly hall in 1933, Hebron, which was replaced by another in 1967, and a new one is under construction.

The first school with teachers’ accommodation was built in 1883, and in 1929, a new one with two classrooms was put into use. It was since been expanded with more classrooms and a gym in 1961. A swimming pool, library and other facilities were added in 1980.

Since 1986, the Bygdarhúsið village hall has been the setting for various local activities. Adjacent to the Effo petrol station, there is a restaurant with bowling facilities.

On the initiative of shipowner Osmund Justinussen, Leirvík opened a local museum, Báta- and Listasavnið, in 2000. The museum has a fine collection of boats with equipment and other maritime objects. It also has a large collection of works by the local visual artists Jóannis Kristiansen and Sámal Toftanes. Osmund Justinussen has since gifted the museum to Eysturkommuna.

Football is the most important sport in Leirvík. A football field was established in 1931‑32 and was upgraded with artificial grass in 1995. In 2008, the local sports association, LÍF, founded in 1928, merged with the sports association GÍ in Gøta to become Víkingur.

At the roundabout on the way into the Norðoya Tunnel stands an artwork by Fridtjof Joensen from 1980, which depicts a sinking boat and large wave. The work was erected in memory of residents from Leirvík who have perished at sea.

Nes Kommuna


Nes is an old church village with a vicarage and cemetery and a small landing site that was frequently used in the past. The old grey-painted vicarage from 1863 is seen in the foreground. The old Nes Kirkja from 1843 has been preserved, but is only used on special occasions. The new parish church is Fríðrikskirkjan, located in Toftir. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 After the division of the old Nes Kommuna in 1967, the new Nes Kommuna consisted of the markatal settlements Nes and Toftir and the outlying villages of Saltnes, which have merged into a coherent settlement. Eystnes is the southernmost point on Eysturoy, and on its ridge stand several wind turbines.





Nes settlement


Nes, mentioned in Hundabrævið, covers 20 merkur of copyhold land, which was originally endowed land. The settlement has 360 inhabitants. Since 1632, the Torkilsheyggjur farm has been an annexe farm to Nes vicarage. The sheep herd consists of 400 animals.

The vicarage in Nes dates several hundred years back. After the Reformation, Heini Jonsson, called Heini Havreki, became the Faroe Islands’ first Lutheran vicar. He was appointed vicar in Nes in 1541, and became the first Lutheran dean in the country in 1558. He was also the father of the freebooter Magnus Heinason (Mogens Heinesen).

Before that, the Faroe Islands, which became an independent diocese in 1990, had had 34 deans, 14 of which lived at Nes vicarage. The last dean at the vicarage, who served between 1900 and 1917, was the priest, politician and poet Fríðrikur Petersen, born in Saltnes.

V.U. Hammershaimb, who became vicar in Nes in 1862 and was dean in the period 1867‑78, had a new and modern vicarage built in 1863, which would influence the building custom. The vicarage was in use until a new one was built in 1979 and now houses a local museum and cultural centre.

The church in Nes, neighbouring the old vicarage, was built in 1843 and was the main parish church until 1994, when Fríðrikskirkjan in Toftir was consecrated. The church is listed and is used on special occasions.

Blákrossheimið (the Blue Cross Home), which treats citizens with drug and alcohol addiction, opened in 2014.

Norðskáli (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Norðskáli is located on Eysturoy’s west coast north of the Streymin Bridge. The bridge was built across the Sundini sound to Streymoy in 1973. OLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 Norðskáli has 323 inhabitants and covers 4 merkur, of which 8 gyllin are copyhold land, which is held by a single copyhold tenant, and 3 merkur and 8 are freehold land. The village was first mentioned in 1584. The sheep herd consists of 320 animals.

For centuries, there has been an mussel bed in the sound off Norðskáli. It was not only important as a food source locally, but also as a source of income, as the mussels were sailed to Tórshavn to be sold.

The bridge across the sound and Norðskáli’s central location together with Oyrarbakki have meant that the village has developed as a trade centre with several businesses and new settlements.

The church is from 1931 and is built in plastered concrete with a red-painted asbestos roof according to drawings by H.C.W. Tórgarð. It was extended and had extensions made on each side in 1977. The first school was built in 1898, but today the children go to the mixed school in Oyrarbakki.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Eysturkommuna’s town hall in Norðragøta is an example of recent architecture that integrates the building into the surrounding nature. It was designed by Henning Larsen Architects A/S. NIC LEHOUX/HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS, 2018 The markatal settlement of Norðragøta has 655 inhabitants and covers 32 merkur. 24 merkur and 8 gyllin are copyhold land distributed between six copyhold tenants. 7 merkur and 8 gyllin are freehold land. The largest copyhold farm covers 9 merkur and 5 gyllin, and it is also one of the few large dairy farms. The sheep herd consists of 995 animals.

The first port facility in Norðragøta came in 1945 and has since been expanded several times. Today, the settlement has a large fishing port with a relatively large quay area. This is also where the settlement’s largest company, Fiskavirkið í Gøtu, which has approx. 100 employees and mainly produces salted fish for markets in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, is located. There are also several other smaller companies in the port area, including some related to the salmon farming industry. There are several salmon farms in the Gøtuvík bay.

Eysturkommuna’s town hall in Norðragøta is an example of recent architecture that integrates the building into the surrounding nature. It was designed by Henning Larsen Architects A/S. NIC LEHOUX/HENNING LARSEN ARCHITECTS, 2018 Norðragøta had a sports field early on, which has since been expanded and modernised, so that there is now a football pitch in Sørpugerði, where the sports association Víkingur (2008) has a new clubhouse. Víkingur, which won the Faroese football championship in both 2016 and 2017, is a merger of the former sports associations in Gøta and Leirvík.

Eysturkommuna’s town hall is located in Norðragøta and was inaugurated in 2018. The building is 750 m2 and with its turf roof, it looks like it has grown out of the ground.

trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Oyri has 166 inhabitants and has 12 merkur of copyhold land, which are divided between three copyhold tenants. The sheep herd consists of 442 animals.

A plateau at a height of 200‑300 m to the east and south of the village constitutes part of the surface of the so-called Eysturoy sill. To the south, this sill bends upwards and ends in a prominent peak on Reyðafelstindur.

The business potential of Oyri was revived when O.C. Joensen, which started as a traditional trading and shipping company, later invested in fishing and the production of shrimp and shellfish. The company, which has since been taken over by the shipping company P/F Thor in Hósvík, has its own ships for shellfish fishing. Another, now closed company was Garnavirkið, which manufactured fishing nets and tools.

Rituvík (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Rituvík is an outlying village from Toftir and was established in 1873. The village currently has 317 inhabitants. The village lies in an inlet facing the open sea, where surf often crashes against the shore. There is a landing site and boat houses on both sides of the inlet. When the weather is good, it is an excellent place to dive in the water off the village where there is a kelp forest with sandy patches on the seabed and underwater caves. Glyvrafjall north of Rituvík rises 303 m. On the beach, a rare geological phenomenon was formed by the filling of a lava tunnel while the lava was still molten. The old path to the village of Lamba leads past the 220 kg stone, which the legendary hero Ole the Strong is said to have lifted.

Rituvík had its first school in 1892, and a new one was built in 1965 by Lamhauge & Waagstein. The school is now as part of the municipality’s after-school program.

The inhabitants used Nes Kirkja until 1955 when Rituvík got its first church. The wooden church is the last of the eight churches designed by the architect H.C.W. Tórgarð. The church bell is a ship’s bell from the Portuguese schooner Florentine, which sank in Greenland in 1947. The church acquired a bigger bell in 1995.

In 1975, a sculpture by Fridtjof Joensen was placed by the church to commemorate the first settlements in Rituvík. The sculpture is a man with a digging tool called a haki and a woman with knitting needles. There is also a memorial stone at the village’s oldest house. Captain Anton Olsen, who was from Rituvík, rescued 4,004 Vietnamese refugees in 1975 with his ship Clara Mærsk after the fall of Saigon, and in 2015, a commemorative tablet was placed in front of his childhood home.

Runavík (Settlement) and Runavíkar Municipality


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The roundabout at the new tunnel entrance in Runavík, December 2020. The Eysturoy Tunnel is state-owned but funded by tolls on drivers using the tunnel. The tunnel was built by NCC contractors and has cost around DKK 1 billion. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/ABACA/RITZAU SCANPIX Since 1967, the outlying village of Runavík also been the name of the third largest municipality in the Faroe Islands. The first inhabitants settled in Runavík in 1916, however, both here and in Saltangará, the population did not start to grow until after World War II when businesses and the fishing industry started to expand. Between 1955 and 2021, the population in the Runavík area grew from 493 to 2,129. There are 591 inhabitants in Runavík itself.

The markatal settlement of Glyvrar has 433 inhabitants and covers 16 merkur of copyhold land distributed between three copyhold tenants. There is no freehold land, and the sheep herd consists of 342 animals.

The first residence in the outlying village of Saltangará was registered in 1846. It was formerly also called Heiðarnar (The Heaths), which is still used by many. Here the civil servants in Tórshavn had their peat farms, from where peat for fuel was transported by rowing boats to Tórshavn. It is said that the copyhold tenants in Glyvrar were against anyone settling in the area for a long time. Saltangará currently has 1,069 inhabitants.

Population trends in Runavík, Saltangará and Glyvrar 1966‑2021.

HAGSTOVA FØROYA The old Nes Kommuna, which consisted of the villages of Glyvrar, Saltangará, Runavík, Lamba, Skipanes, Søldarfjørður, Toftir, Rituvík and Æðuvík, was divided into two independent municipalities in 1967, Nes Kommuna and Runavíkar Kommuna. Following a referendum, the latter came to consist of the villages of Glyvrar, Saltangará, Runavík, Lamba, Skipanes, Søldarfjørður and the two outlying villages of Rituvík and Æðuvík, which are located in the territory of the markatal settlement of Toftir. Furthermore, in the period 2005‑09, the municipality merged with the three former municipalities of Funnings-Elduvíkar, Oyndarfjarðar and Skála Kommuna.

Runavíkar Kommuna cooperates with the neighbouring municipalities on schools, health care and the elderly, day-care facilities, child protection, fire brigade, etc.

Glyvrar, Saltangará and Runavík form a coherent urban village and will in the following mainly be referred to as Runavík.





Port expansion and workplaces


Runavík is the administrative centre of Runavíkar Kommuna and has an important fishing port with significant exports. It has a rich industry with a number of small machine factories, construction companies and many service companies and businesses. Along the main street, there are shops, businesses and cultural institutions. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 In the early 1900s, there were plans to build a large port in the area because of the good location and because it was not affected by tidal currents. However, the port was not built because the rural district believed that the water was too deep and that a breakwater would be needed to protect against northerly winds and the accompanying waves. In addition, it was believed that there were too few inhabitants in the area for the construction work to pay off.

Local businessman Símun Simonsen á Høgabóli therefore paid for a jetty in Saltangará in 1909, expecting that the municipality would build a larger port at some later point. However, this did not happen as they were unable to agree on the location. A new proposal was put forward in 1930, but was abandoned for financial reasons. Construction of a pier was started in 1940 during the British occupation in World War II, which was completed in 1947. The expansion of the port area has continued since then, with some intermissions. A newly built port facility was commissioned in 2000, and a deep-water port up to 15 meters deep is still in the making to be able to accommodate large ships. Every year, several cruise ships call on Runavíkar Port, which has developed into a regional powerhouse over the past 60‑70 years.

There are also marinas in both Runavík and other villages in the municipality as well as a relatively new port facility at Glyvrar. This facility is mainly used by the salmon company Bakkafrost, which is the area’s largest workplace with 700 employees. There is also a port facility in Søldarfjørður.

Faroe Origin produces fish products other than salmon and has approx. 120 employees.

At Runavíkar Port, a supplybase has served as a base for oil exploration projects in the Faroe Islands, however, this has been less active in recent years. Added to this there are several other derived workplaces within the maritime area, service businesses and shops as well as hotels and restaurants.





Churches and meeting houses


Glyvrar Kirkja consists of the old building from 1927 and on the left, the extension from 1981. Each year, the church forms the setting for several art exhibitions. Music always accompanies the opening of the exhibitions, and most times the artist also attends to talk about his works and the exhibition. The plan is to build a new church in the coming years. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 The parish church in the Runavík area is Glyvrar Kirkja from 1927. It was designed by the then vicar of Nes, Vilhelm Nielsen, and was rebuilt in 1981 according to drawings by architect J.P. Gregoriussen with an extension inspired by the Faroese boat houses. In 1968, the Brethren congregation acquired the Berøa meeting house in Saltangará; it was the former Ebenezer meeting house in Tórshavn, which was dismantled and rebuilt in the village.

The Home Mission, the evangelical branch of the Established Church, has a mission house, the free church Livets Ord (Word of Life) has a meeting house, and Jehovah’s Witnesses have a kingdom hall.





Health care and social institutions


In 1927, a medical practice with an accompanying doctor’s residence was established in Saltangará, designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð. The practice covered a large catchment area; today, Runavík is the centre of a comprehensive health care service with a doctor, dentist, midwife, district psychiatry, laboratory, pharmacy, etc.

The nursing home and old-age home Eysturoyar Røktar- og Ellisheim, which was established in 1984 for the whole of Eysturoy, has been expanded several times and currently has 70 places. Since old-age care was transferred to the municipalities by law in 2015, it has been part of the cooperation within oldage care between the municipalities at Skálafjørður and is managed under the joint institution Roðin.

The local women’s association, Kongshavnar Kvinnufelag, established an institution for children in 1982. Since then, several day-care facilities for children have been established with nurseries, kindergartens and after-school facilities as well as other offers for children and young people.





Schools and teaching


Teaching in the villages at Skálafjørður began in 1840, which was much earlier than elsewhere. The first school building with teacher’s accommodation was built in 1845 in Saltnes, from where the teacher taught in several other villages. After the village schools were closed in 1854, teaching was not resumed until 1870, two years before the new school act in 1872. In 1890, a school opened in Glyvrar.

A new school opened in the village in 1958, which in addition to classrooms also had specialised classrooms, a gym and a dental clinic. The building was designed by the local architect Niels Pauli Hansen. From 1960, pupils were taught in preparation for the school leaving examination, and in 1976 Runavíkar Kommunuskúli was opened with both a secondary school and 8th-10th grade.

The newest central school in Runavíkar Kommuna, Skúlin við Løkin from 2008, offers a wide range of facilities.

Bylgjan, which is a combination of a sports hall and a cultural centre, is a handball arena from the 1980s that has been expanded into a sports and multi-arena in 2014. The handball arena was 1,100 m2 and was expanded with 2,400 m2. The arena was designed by BBP Arkitekter, and the project owners were Runavíkar Kommuna and Danish Foundation for Culture and Sports Facilities. MARTIN SIRKOVSKY FOR THE DANISH FOUNDATION FOR CULTURE AND SPORTS FACILITIES, 2012





Culture and sports


The local library, Bókasavnið við Løkin, is, together with the cultural hall Løkshøll, part of the new school complex in Runavík and regularly organises art exhibitions.

The local museum Forni i Glyvrar was founded in 1986 and is housed in Niels Pauli Hansen’s private home, a functionalistic house that he designed and built himself. The museum exhibits tools for both outdoor and indoor work and a shop with items from the 1930s. The museum also has changing exhibitions with different cultural and historical topics. Niels Pauli Hansen left his mark on both private houses and public buildings in the area.

In terms of sports, people are active in clubs offering badminton (Nápur), archery (Bogaskjótifelagið Ørvur), handball (Tjaldur), sports for the disabled (Ítróttarfelagið Svanur), rowing (NSÍ kappróður), football (NSÍ), gymnastics (Støkk), taekwondo (Hwarang Føroyar), golf (Eysturoyar Golffelag), horse riding (Ríðifelagið Sleipnir) and billiards (Skálafjarðar Billardfelag).

The almost 3,500-m2 Bylgjan sports hall and cultural centre was completed in 2014. The facility, which was both designed and built by the Copenhagen-based company BBP Arkitekter, has large windows that integrate the sports hall with the surrounding nature. Here, you can do gymnastics, handball, badminton and archery, etc., and it is the venue for conferences, concerts and other cultural activities. There are plans to expand Bylgjan with a swimming pool.

The municipal cultural initiatives include Laksatorgið (salmon market), which is held every year in July and is an outdoor market with tastings, various sales and entertainment for all ages. Byarskáði is held in November: After decorating for Christmas, there are a couple of days with concerts and other entertainment and where the shops have long opening hours.

Each year at the end of April, a culture week is held with concerts, plays, art exhibitions and sports. Every two years, the local business community holds the conference Faroexpo in Runavík with an exhibition of products and various social and cultural events.

The Runavík area, 2021, with the villages of Runavík at the bottom, Saltangará in the middle and Glyvrar at the top. All three villages have merged into a coherent settlement.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The teacher Johannes Petersen was a significant figure in Saltnes, where he worked in the mid-1800s and again from 1870. 8966F0000002, TJÓÐSAVNIÐ The first settlers came to the outlying village of Saltnes in 1837. The village has an important place in Faroese school history. In 1843, the materials from the old Nes Kirkja were used for the construction of a school building and a teacher’s accommodation in Saltnes, and the school, which opened in 1845, covered the villages of Saltnes, Nes, Toftir, Glyvrar and Strendur. Johannes Petersen from Klaksvík worked there as a teacher. All village schools were closed in 1854 until a new act on village schools was passed in 1872, however, Johannes Petersen was already re-employed as a teacher at the school in Saltnes in 1870. This school closed in 1895 after the construction of the school in Toftir. Johannes Petersen had retired the year before, but his daughter Johanne Petersen, who had been an assistant teacher since 1888, continued working as a teacher in Toftir for the rest of her life. Johannes Petersen was also the father of the dean Fríðrikur Petersen. Today, Saltnes has 139 inhabitants.

Skálafjørður (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The undersea tunnel, the Eysturoy Tunnel, was built in the period 2016‑1920 and is the Faroe Islands’ largest structure to date. It connects both sides of Skálafjørður on Eysturoy and Tórshavn on Streymoy. Tróndur Patursson created the artwork that was fitted around the tunnel’s roundabout. The chain of people holding each other’s hands gives associations to the traditional Faroese chain dance, but should, according to the artist, be understood as a broader portrait of Faroese unity as a prerequisite for the development of society. Eyðun Eliasen is the architect behind the portals and the light in the tunnel, which has several colours. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 The outlying village of Skálafjørður or Skálabotnur, located at the bottom of the fjord Skálafjørður, was first mentioned in 1630. Here the river Fjarðará runs into the fjord at a sandy beach.

The Christian Keldan congregation settled here in 1987, and a large centre with a well-equipped meeting hall was built in 2004. The Keldan congregation also runs a private independent school with classes from 0 to 7th grade. Skálafjørður has 132 inhabitants.

Skáli (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The shipyard in Skála began its operations in 1904. Since then, it has been expanded and rebuilt, and it has had several owners. The shipyard has the Faroe Islands’ only dry dock and is today owned by the MEST group, which also owns the shipyards in Tórshavn and Vestmanna. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 Skáli, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 739 inhabitants and covers 40 merkur divided into 27 merkur and 15 gyllin of freehold land and 12 merkur and 1 gyllin of copyhold land. The copyhold land is divided between three copyhold tenants. The sheep herd consists of 1,022 animals. It stretches from Innan Glyvur to the bottom of Skálafjørður, where it borders Funningur, Elduvík and Syðrugøta.

The highest mountains in the village are Halgafelstindur at 758 m and Reyðafelstindur at 766 m. The distinctive peak on Reyðafelstindur is an offshoot of the Eysturoy sill.

The shipyard is one of the most important workplaces in Skáli. Its history goes back to 1901 when two shipowners from Tórshavn, Jens í Dali and Søren Müller, bought an old slipway in England, which was put into use in 1904 under the name Kongshavn Shipyard. The shipyard was taken over in 1941 by A/S J.F. Kjølbro in Klaksvík, which for many years also had several companies within fishing and the fishing industry in the village. In 1997, the shipyard was acquired by Tórshavnar Skipasmiðja, and it is today part of MEST, which has shipyards in both Tórshavn and Vestmanna.

Another large company is EL-Service P/F, which was established in 1988 in J.F. Kjølbro’s old fish drying house. With around 30 employees, the company mainly works with electricity on board ships and in tunnels.

The village has a convenience store and a bakery, Bakaríðið á Skála, which also supplies other villages with goods. Until 1940, the inhabitants of Skáli used the church við Sjógv in Strendur.

After 1940, the village had its own church designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð and built of concrete with an eternit roof. It has since then been restored. A parish hall was built in 1960. The Baptists’ hall Neria is from 1979.

In 1965, a school designed by Lamhauge & Waagstein was built, and a new building was commissioned in 1990. Skála Skúli has classes from 1st to 7th grade, after which the pupils continue at the central school við Løkin in Runavík. Barnahúsið Sillan is an integrated institution. Eldrasambílið á Skála is a relief care home for people with dementia, which is part of the municipal collaboration within old-age care at Skálafjørður.

A football club was established in 1965, and the village also has rowing club. The village has a football field and a sports hall with an assembly hall. In 2013, the association Fornminnisfelag fyri Skála og Skálafjørð was established, which runs a local museum.

Strendur (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur With its small marina, the neighbourhood við Sjógv in Strendur with Kirkjan við Sjógv and the cemetery is located as an enclave between the old village road and a new road along the beach. SIMON M. NORDENDAL, 2018 Strendur has 923 inhabitants and covers 40 merkur and 2 gyllin. 19 merkur and 14 gyllin are copyhold land distributed between four copyhold tenants, and 20 merkur and 4 gyllin are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 400 animals.

Strendur comprises the four býlingar Við Sjógv, í Selvendi, á Heyggi and Gerðar. The name Strendur was first used as a common designation in 1732 but does not feature regularly in the church registers until the period 1833‑54. In The Dog Letter, the place is referred to as Raktangi, which is also the name of the southernmost tongue of land at the entrance to Skálafjørður.

There are several small port and boat facilities along the fjord. At Hulkur, at the northern end of the village, lies a large quay facility where the fishing company Vaðhorn is located. Other companies in the village include Snældan, which processes Faroese wool into various types of knitwear.

The road tunnel that connects the village with Runavík on the other side of the fjord and with Tórshavn comes up at í Selvindi. The tunnel has shortened the road to Tórshavn from 75 km to 14 km.

The church við Sjógv was built in 1834 and is a traditional wooden church with a turf roof. It was built by David Petersen from Kollafjørður. The altarpiece, Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, is a copy of Carl Bloch’s work of the same name, painted by Anna Wesenberg.

The first school opened in Strendur in 1887. A new school was built in 1969 and expanded in 1984 and again in 2011. It now has a swimming pool and is the central school in the municipality. The Home Mission has had great impact on the settlement.

The first mission house was built in 1936, and in 2018 a new and larger mission house was opened. Stranda Blákrossfelag, which is part of the Christian aid organisation Blue Cross, is very active and organises an annual Blue Cross party.

The village has had an integrated day-care facility since 2006, which was expanded with an after-school facility in 2008. An assembly or communal house built in 1979 was taken over by the municipality in 1996 and is now the venue for several social and cultural activities such as dancing, music, choir singing and Christian meetings. In 1981, the orchestra Tønsikt set a Faroese record selling 6,000 copies of the cassette tape Har bylgjan leikar.

The village’s pensioners’ association was founded in 1996 and offers many activities from its premises at the port. The museum association Sjóvar Fornminnafelag, founded in 2009, owns four old houses in the port area á Høvdanum. The association has also taken over Turkihúsið, a fish drying house from 1950, which today serves as a local museum.

The sports association Stranda Ítróttarfelag (StÍF, founded in 1942) focuses particularly on handball. The youth and sports club Strálan, founded in 1989, is mostly active in rowing. There is also a judo association, which was founded in 2011.

In 1976, a memorial was erected on Raktangi, commemorating those in the municipality who have perished at sea. Their names are engraved in the stone, and a ceremony is held on 1 November each year. The outlying village of Innan Glyvur between Strendur and Skála was established in 1884. The parish’s new vicarage was built there in 1971.





Military installations during World War II


During World War II, Strendur, which is located at the entrance to Skálafjørður, had great strategic importance both for shipping traffic and for the protection of the important oil reserves at Søldarfjørður. The British established a military base with guns and other artillery in the area úti á Bergi, where they stationed about 100 soldiers, and smaller military installation with guns and artillery in Innan Glyvur, where barracks were also built for soldiers. Clear traces of the military installations can still be seen.

Sunda Municipality


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The markatal settlements of Norðskáli and Oyri and the outlying village of Oyrarbakki on the other side of the sound formerly constituted Sunda Kommuna. The bridge across the sound between Eysturoy and Streymoy significantly improved the infrastructure in the area, and it was at about the same time that it was decided by the authorities to merge the small municipalities. Following a referendum, this resulted in the merger of Norðskáli, Oyrarbakki, Oyrar and Gjógv, all municipalities on Eysturoy, with Hósvík, Hvalvík, Streymnes, Saksun, Haldarsvik and Tjørnuvík on Streymoy into the new Sunda Kommuna in 2005.

The merger meant that several small village schools were closed, and three schools eventually had to cover the entire municipality: the schools in Hósvík and Hvalvík and the mixed school Skúlin við Streymin in Oyrarbakki, which was built in 1969 and expanded in 1973. The first two schools only cover the youngest grades, while the mixed school covers all grades. The old schools are used for leisure-time education and other after-school activities.

The villages of Hósvík, Hvalvík and Oyrarbakki have kindergartens and nurseries. The old Garnhúsið á Oyri, the yarn house, has become a youth centre, and Sunda and Eiðis Kommuna are both involved in the Norðljómur music school. Together with the neighbouring municipalities of Vestmanna, Eiðis and Kvívíkar Kommuna, Sunda Kommuna has entered into the VEKS collaboration, a joint institution which manages old-age care such as home care, health care services and food delivery.

For the municipality as a whole, the large villages have grown considerably, while the small and remote villages have stagnated, and in some places the population has declined.

Syðrugøta (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Syðrugøta has 479 inhabitants and covers 32 merkur and 10 gyllin. 25 merkur and 10 gyllin are copyhold land that is distributed between 7 copyhold tenants. 5 merkur are freehold land. The largest copyhold farm, Húsgarður, covers 10 merkur and 4 gyllin and is the oldest in the settlement. The sheep population consists of 926 animals.

Archaeological investigations have shown that there used to be a settlement already during the Landnam period, and according to legend, Tróndur í Gøtu had a farm in the area. Traces of a cemetery have been found, which suggest that there also used to be a church in Syðrugøta.

As in other places, sheep farming is no longer of major economic importance, however, Syðrugøta has a dairy farm. Since the inter-war period, companies that produce fish products such as fishmeal and herring oil have been located in the village. In 1929, a fish factory that produced dried cod opened, but it moved to Norðragøta, where the expansion of the port offered better opportunities.

The wool spinning mill Tøtingarvirkið has been an important workplace in the settlement since 1960. The company closed down in 1986, but opened again between 1991 and 2010. It produced yarn from Faroese wool as well as a large selection of knitwear. The buildings are now used for other purposes, including in connection with the G! Festival and other cultural events. The country’s largest shipping company, Varðin, is headquartered in Syðrugøta.

The shipping company owns several of the ships that catch pelagic fish species in the Faroe Islands.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Søldarfjørður, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 374 inhabitants and is an old markatal settlement consisting of 12 merkur of copyhold land divided equally between two copyhold tenants. There is no freehold land in the village. The sheep herd consists of 220 animals.

The Brethren congregation has the meeting house Elim, and the Home Mission also has a meeting house in the village. The village’s first school was built in 1892, and a new one was built in 1956, designed and built by Niels Pauli Hansen. This school has since been rebuilt and expanded with a swimming pool.

During World War II, the British military built an oil depot with several oil tanks in Søldarfjørður. After the war, the plot of land and depot were acquired by the Faroese authorities, and shortly afterwards trees were planted in the area, which today forms a plantation with a playground. The port has been expanded and is still under development.

Most of the crew from the fishing cutter Imanuel, which sank off Iceland in 1932, was from Søldarfjørður. A memorial stone was mounted in their honour in the village in 1983.

Toftir (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 Toftir has 900 inhabitants and covers 20 merkur, of which 16 are copyhold land distributed between seven copyhold tenants. There are 4 merkur of freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 633 animals.

The name Toftir, which means ruins, could indicate that the village has been deserted and has since been repopulated. Tofte can also mean »separate piece of land near the farm«. Place names such as Krossbakki, the hill of the cross, originate from Catholic times.

From having two farms in 1584, the village grew from the latter half of the 19th century as large parts of the outfield were cultivated into traðir, at the same time that the outlying villages of Saltnes, Rituvík and Æðuvík were established.

After free trade was introduced, fishing and the production of dried cod became very important here and elsewhere in the Faroe Islands, leading to the establishment of trading stations and businesses. Until the mid-20th century, the trading and shipping company D.P. Højgaard’s Eftf. was one of the country’s leading companies.

In 1968, the Nykur fish filleting factory was established in the port area, and it remained the village’s most important workplace until the early 1990s. The port facility has been expanded in several stages to be able to accommodate more fishing and shipping companies, including M.J. Saltsøla, which sells salt to ships and companies. It is also the headquarters of Fiskamarknaður Føroya (Faroe Fish Market), which was established in 1993.

The first school was built in Toftir in 1895. The current school is designed by Niels Pauli Hansen and opened in 1958. It has since been rebuilt and renovated, most recently in 2008, and has classes from 1st to 10th grade.

The municipality’s new church, Fríðrikskirkjan, was consecrated in 1994. Both the building and the interior are designed by Høgni Larsen. The Home Mission has the Tabor mission house, and the Brethren congregation has the Nebo meeting house.

The old-age and nursing home Eldrasambílið Vesturskin opened in 2004 and is part of the municipal cooperation organised under the joint institution Roðin. The home has 16 places.

The village’s sports facility at Svangaskarð, which is a combined athletics and football facility, was completed in 1992 and initially served as the home ground for the Faroese national football team. The facility is now a training and course centre for the Faroese football association as well as the home ground for the local football club.

In the same area, you can also find a kindergarten and a nursery.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Around 1850, a farmer’s son from Syðrugøta settled in Undir Gøtueiði at Skálafjørður. Here, the inhabitants of Gøta had had boats moored at Skipanes for centuries, and they also stored peat fuel, which had been dug up in the Millum Fjarða valley at the end of Skálafjørður in the outfield belonging to Syðrugøta. The easiest way to transport it was by boat.

Several residential houses were built on the site towards the end of the 19th century. Today, Undir Gøtueiði has merged with the other outlying village of Skipanes. They share a small marina here. Undir Gøtueiði has 31 inhabitants.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Æðuvík is an outlying village established in 1897 and has 104 inhabitants. A little to the north of the village is the old Tinghella, a bedrock where the spring council was formerly held. There is a small landing site, where there can be a lot of surf.

According to old folklore, many wood spirits have lived in Æðuvík, and one had to be especially careful when walking along the old path between Æðuvík and Nes and by the small Promsgil stream.

In 2001, Æðuvík was named the best preserved village. At Christmas time, Æðuvík is now known as the Christmas village where people decorate with a lot of lights and specially made Christmas decorations.

In 1997, a memorial was erected to celebrate the village’s 100th anniversary: Photographs of the first four couples who settled here have been transferred to stone slabs by stone mason Árni Ziska from Strendur.

The monument is surrounded by a stone structure. The village also has a camping site.

Fugloy (Island)


trap.fo



	 	 Fugloy covers an area of 11.18 km² and is the smallest and most northeastern of Norðoyggjar. The highest point on the island is the 621 m high Klubbin. The island’s two villages are Hattarvík on the eastern part and Kirkja on the southern part.

To the northeast, Fugloy lies open to the Atlantic Ocean, while to the south the island is separated from Svínoy by Fugloyarfjørður, waters that can be treacherous to navigate in winter and where the local landing sites are primitive. In December 1941, the British ship Sauternes went down in a storm in Fugloyarfjørður. The ship came from England with Christmas supplies for the British soldiers in the Faroe Islands. Due to a fatal misunderstanding, it lay in wait for better weather in Fugloyarfjørður, believing that the ship was safe off the village of the same name.

There is a road between the villages and ports at both villages. Today, the sea route is supplemented by regular helicopter service, but landing conditions can be extremely difficult or impossible in bad weather, particularly in winter.

Fugloy has been an independent municipality since 1932. The population reached its maximum in 1935 at 227 inhabitants. In the period 1966‑2020, it fell from 105 people to 43. Of these, around 30 live in Kirkja and the rest in Hattarvík.

The parish church has been in Kirkja since 1592, as suggested by its name. The church was worn down in 1833, but due to a fatal boat accident in 1818, in which many men drowned, it was not possible to build a new one. Hattarvík therefore became the church village. In 1933, a new church was built in Kirkja, designed by the local-born engineer and politician Louis Zachariassen. The altarpiece was painted by S. Joensen-Mikines.

Kirkja had its first school building in 1866, which covers the entire island as of 2021. In 2021, it had two pupils.

Following a local initiative and with the help of young people through ActionAid Denmark, a covered swimming pool was opened in connection with the village hall in 1983.

The island has a small port, and there is a daily ferry connection between Gamlarætt and Hestur. Fishing used to be an important occupation, but that is no longer the case.

Kalsoy (Island)


trap.fo



	 	 With its steep mountain sides, the highest mountain being 788 m, and sounds on both sides, Kalsoy has become particularly famous after filming for the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2011 Kalsoy has an area of 30.87 km² and is located west of Kunoy; the two islands are separated by Kalsoyarfjørður. Kalsoy has four markatal settlements, all of which are located on the east side of the island. Of the four villages, Trøllanes, Mikladalur and Húsar are the oldest, while Syðradalur was founded in 1812.

The highest mountain on Kalsoy is the 788-m high Nestindar west of Trøllanes. The mountain Borgarin further north has a vertical 537-m mountain side on the west side. Poul Johannesen, also called Páll Fangi, was a historical person from Mikladalur, who three times managed to escape the prison in Tórshavn where he was incarcerated on charges of sorcery and for taking his father’s life. It is said that he hid in the Pállsloft cave on this steep mountain side, and he reportedly offered to climb the vertical mountain side in 1657 to be released.

In the period 1978‑1985, tunnels were drilled to all the villages on the island. Syðradalur has a ferry landing, from where a car ferry sails to and from Klaksvík, which has improved living conditions on the island. However, the number of inhabitants on Kalsoy as a whole fell drastically from 195 to 79 between 1966 and 2010.

Some scenes of the James Bond film No Time to Die (2021) were recorded on Kalsoy.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Hans Pauli Olsen’s statue The Seal Woman, standing by the surf and looking towards land, was erected in 2014. It is a significant tourist attraction, but at the same time it has raised questions about representation and symbolism: Should she, in fact, have looked out towards the water and thus turned her back on the village and her abuser instead of turning her gaze towards them? ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 Mikladalur has 27 inhabitants and covers 24 merkur and 14 gyllin, of which 13 merkur and 2 gyllin are copyhold land and 11 merkur and 12 gyllin are freehold land. The copyhold land is divided between four copyhold tenants. The sheep herd consists of 709 animals. The village has had a church since 1592, maybe even earlier.

The church in Mikladalur was built in 1859, but was rebuilt in 1915.

In Faroese folklore, Mikladalur is particularly known for the legend of the seal woman, and in 2014, the sculpture The Seal Woman, made by the artist Hans Pauli Olsen, was placed by the beach facing the sea, so that the surf sometimes washes over it.

The sheep herd consists of 420 animals.

The old village of Blankaskáli, first mentioned in 1584, was hit by an avalanche in 1809. No one died, but the traces of the repeated and deadly avalanches in Gerðum on Borðoy frightened the inhabitants, so they moved to the eastern part of the island where the village of Syðradalur was founded in 1812. The last inhabitants left Blankaskáli in 1816, which has since been deserted.

As it lies unprotected and facing the sea, Trøllanes has poor landing conditions and could be cut off from the outside world for extended periods during winter. The village used to have no cemetery, so people had to carry the coffins along the narrow path that led to Mikladalur and the southern villages. In some places the path was so narrow that the body had to be taken out of the coffin, and both body and coffin had to be carried on the back. Trøllanes did not get its own cemetery until around 1830. The village was connected by road via a tunnel in 1985.

The restoration began in the 1980s and was completed in 2012 with the support of The A.P. Møller and Chastine Mc-Kinney Møller Foundation. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2015 The 2.3-km² island of Koltur covers 17 merkur of copyhold land and has no permanent residents. The sheep herd consists of 160 animals. Since 2015, Koltur has been part of Tjóðsavnið (the Faroe Islands National Museum), which manages the island as an openair museum.

In 2013, management of the island of Koltur passed to Tjóðsavnið, which actively works with conservation, research and dissemination of the cultural and naturalhistorical values on the island. With its 230 ha, Koltur is the smallest inhabited island in the Faroe Islands; a habitation which can be traced back to the Viking Age.

With its restored residential houses, outbuildings and boathouse, Heimi í Húsi, which is the island’s original býlingur (neighbourhood), is a particularly wellpreserved example of the old farming community. The newer neighbourhood Norðri í Gerði is located further north on the island. This is where you will find the Gróthústangi isthmus, named after the outbuildings (gróthús) used to store fuel peat and foodstuffs. In the infield, which is bounded by stone fences, the distinctive teigalendi (grain fields) can be seen, which in 1995 became part of an extensive conservation project involving buildings and cultural landscape at Koltur.

The inhabitants of Hvalba are very proud of the island, which they went to great lengths to secure. On the island, a cabin has been set up in the mountainside where the owners can spend the night when they collect the sheep. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2021 Lítla Dímun is an uninhabited island of 0.82 km², which is estimated at 1 mørk and 8 gyllin.

The island was formerly leasehold land, which in 1850 was sold at auction to the inhabitants of Hvalba. The sheep herd consists of 280 animals.

A small shelter has been built on the island, where it is possible to stay while driving the sheep and catching birds. In autumn, the sheep are sold at auction, and the proceeds go to Lítla Dímun’s common purse.

Mykines (Island)


trap.fo



	 	 Visual artist Sámal Joensen-Mikines was born and raised in Mykines. Several of his artworks have motifs from his home village, such as the neighbourhood of Handan Á in Mykines bygd på Færøerne. Gråvejr from 1955. Mykines has 16 inhabitants and covers 40 merkur. 12 merkur, 10 gyllin and 15 skinn are copyhold land distributed between three copyhold tenants. 27 merkur, 5 gyllin and 5 skinn are freehold land and is largely owned by people living elsewhere. The sheep herd consists of 1,020 animals.

The island of Mykineshólmur is the Faroe Islands’ westernmost point connected to the mainland. The first bridge over the Holmgjógv gorge was built in 1909 and has since been replaced. The 40 m long bridge, which can only be used by pedestrians, was built in connection with the establishment of the lighthouse on Mykineshólmur. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2009 The island of Mykines has steep, rugged shores and an unreliable landing site, which cannot be used for weeks during onshore winds. A deep, approx. 50 m wide gorge, Holmgjógv, separates Mykines from Mykineshólmur. The highest point on Mykines is Knúkur. On 17 September 1970, an Icelandair plane crashed on Mykines on its way to Vágar. Eight out of the total of 34 people on board died.

The church was built in 1879 and the school in 1897. The school is, in principle, not closed if there are any children of school age in the village.

When the Mykines lighthouse was established, a bridge was built across the gorge in 1909, which has since been renewed. In the 1930s, housing was built for the lighthouse keepers on Mykineshólmur, but after the lighthouse service was automated around 1970, no one has lived permanently on Mykineshólmur. However, the lighthouse keeper’s residence is still intact.

Until after World War II, Mykines was a well-functioning local community. In the 1930s, the number of school children peaked at around 30, and there were several young people in the village. Although access to the sea could be difficult, the distance to the fishing grounds was short. Longdistance fishing in summer, which started at the end of the 1800s, was in harmony with life in the village, where the young men went fishing, but there were still enough people at home to take care of the land, catch birds, etc.

Mykineshólmur is the only place in the Faroe Islands where northern gannets are found, and they are still caught in the traditional way once a year. Bird catches used to be very important, but a decline in the bird population means that the seabirds are protected for the time being. Mykineshólmur also used to be famous for breeding oxen for slaughter, which were transported to Tórshavn every year and sold to butchers.

Mykines was electrified in the mid- 1960s, but by then, its remote location and the periodic inaccessibility had meant that many families had moved, and traditional village life became difficult due to the modest population. Sheep farming is carried out in the traditional way, but requires periodic help from the outside, and cattle are no longer found on the island.

Mykines is one of the country’s most important tourist attractions, to which a liner sails from Sørvágur in summer with tourists who are going on hikes through the ‘land of the puffin’ to see the many birds and on across the bridge to Mykineshólmur. Most people go on a one-day trip, but it is possible to eat and stay the night on the island. The ferry connection is unstable in winter, but there is a regular helicopter service.

Visual artist Sámal Joensen-Mikines was born and raised in Mykines.

JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2018 The 10.3-km² island of Nólsoy, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 234 inhabitants and covers 48 merkur. 13 merkur are copyhold land distributed between five copyhold tenants, and 35 merkur are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 768 animals.

In Korndalur, south of the village, you can see the ruins of an abandoned byling. As in other villages, fishing used to be the main occupation together with the fishing industry, but many now work outside the island. In addition, the village’s music venue, cafés and tourism have gained increasing importance.

Since 1893, there has been a lighthouse on Borðan as well as residences for the lighthouse keeper and his helpers; the lighthouse was automated in 1995. The church was built in 1863. The first school was built in 1887, and a new one was built in 1970. The old houses við Brunn from the 17th century have been preserved as historical monuments. The sailor and national hero Poul Poulsen Nolsøe, better known as Nólsoyar-Páll, was born on Nólsoy.

The artist Steffan Danielsen was born and lived on Nólsoy. The selftaught natural scientist Jens-Kjeld Jensen settled on Nólsoy in 1970. He received the cultural prize Mentanarvirðisløn M.A. Jacobsens in 2012, became an honorary doctor at Fróðskaparsetur Føroya (University of the Faroe Islands) in 2015 and won the Nordic Council’s environment prize in 2020. The sailor Ove Joensen also came from Nólsoy. In 1986, he rowed in his small rowing boat Diana Victoria from the Faroe Islands to Copenhagen in 41 days. His boat is on display in the village, and since 1993 he has been celebrated at an annual summer festival.

Sandoy (Island)


trap.fo



	 	 Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 The three islands of Sandoy at 112.10 km², Skúvoy at 11.18 km² and Stóra Dímun at 2.65 km² include the markatal settlements of Sandur, Skálavík, Húsavík, Skarvanes, Dalur, Skúvoy and Stóra Dímun. Added to this, there is Skopun, an outlying village founded in 1833 on Sandur’s markatal land. These villages constitute Sandoyar Sýsla and the superior parish of Sandoyar Prestagjald.

The three islands constitute five independent municipalities: Skopunar Kommuna, Skálavíkar Kommuna, Sands Kommuna, Húsavíkar Kommuna, which includes Skarvanes and Dalur, and Skúvoyar Kommuna, which includes Stóra Dímun. The islet of Trøllhøvdi, which belongs to the village of Kirkjubøur, is separated from Sandoy by Høvdasund. From the south side of the sound, a special geological phenomenon can be observed, an 80 m long filling of a lava tunnel, which is aptly called Hvalsryggur (the Whale’s Back).

Sandoy is considered the lowest and greenest of the large islands. Its highest mountain is Tindur at 479 m. The Faroe Islands’ third largest lake, Sandsvatn, can also be found on this island. For centuries, Sandoy has been one of the best agricultural areas with large farms. There is no natural harbour on the island, but both Sandur and Skopun have ports for boats and small ships. This has contributed to the establishment of a fishing industry with filleting factories in the two villages.

In the aftermath of the economic crisis around the year 2000, Sandoy attempted to pursue a development strategy, which involved developing the agricultural industry to ensure the production of local food, especially vegetables. So far, there has been a ferry connection between Gamlarætt on Streymoy and Skopun on Sandoy, but an undersea tunnel is under construction. The work of drilling a tunnel between Gamlarætt on Streymoy and Inni á Tungu at Sandur is expected to be completed in 2022.

Dalur (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Dalur has 37 inhabitants and covers 23 merkur. Of these, one mørk is copyhold land leased by a single copyhold tenant, and 22 merkur are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 793 animals.

The village is characterised by the many pebbles that have been washed ashore by the surf and cover the beach. The sound of the pebbles hitting each other is very distinct. The village has a small landing site and is connected by road to Húsavík.

Dalur did not get its own church until 1957. It is built of timber on a stone foundation. The altarpiece depicts the sacrament and was painted in 1960 by Ernst Trier from Vallekilde.

Dalur is know for its rich tradition within Faroese dancing and the pertaining ballad singers. The village has its own dancing club and dance hall.

In older times, Dalur was one of the few villages where seal hunting was an important part of the economy, and seals were caught using nets on Skerhellur.

Húsavík (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Surf at the rocky beach near Húsavík. In the foreground are three gróthús, which are stone houses with turf roofs intended for storing provisions and in some places also peat. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2017 Húsavík, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 65 inhabitants and covers 31 merkur. Of these, 26 merkur are copyhold land leased by a single copyhold tenant, and 5 merkur are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 641 animals.

One of the distinctive features of Húsavík is the almost 10-km long stone walls that encircle the village. This was where húsfrúgvin í Húsavík lived, the rich and powerful Guðrun Sjúrðardóttir, about whom it is said that she revived the village after the Black Death. Several archaeological traces are attributed to her. At the east-facing bay, you can see an almost 500 m long sandy beach with two groups of very old stone houses called á Tumbakka.

The church in Húsavík was built of stone with a turf roof with a partially open roof truss and wooden pews in 1863. It is whitewashed both on the outside and the inside. After a gentle renovation, the church was put into use again in 1991 with a new altarpiece by Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen.

In 1943, the youth organisation Sólaris was established with its own meeting house, which is still the setting for much of the social life in the village.

In the 1980s, Húsavík had a new boat port built by J&K Petersen Contractors in collaboration with Tróndur Patursson, who was in charge of the decorating of the port with scenes from the sea.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Sands Kirkja in Sandur was commissioned in 1839 and is a traditional wooden church. Archaeological excavations have found several other churches before this. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 Sandur, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 537 inhabitants and covers 96 merkur and 12 gyllin. 55 merkur and 8 gyllin are copyhold land, which is distributed between 24 copyhold tenants, and 41 merkur and 4 gyllin are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 3,064 animals.

Central Sandur with important common facilities marked, 2021. From Sandur there is a ferry connection to Skúgvoy.

BASED ON UMHVØRVISSTOVAN Archaeological investigations have documented settlement in the area as early as the 4th-6th centuries, meaning that Sandur is among the oldest villages in the Faroe Islands. The island’s old thingstead is located in Trøðum, where the Tingsteinurin with carved initials and the year 1789 can still be seen.

At the beach, you can see the protected dune formations, which are the only place in the Faroe Islands where marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) grow. Mowi has a salmon farm in the bay off the beach.

The classic wooden church with a turf roof was built in 1839. Archaeological excavations have documented that there have been several other churches before this one, and in 1863, a hoard containing 98 silver coins from around the year 1000 was found in the church area, several of these were coined by the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair.

Central in the village lies is the listed house Norðara Koytu, which serves as a native museum.

The Listasavnið á Sandi art museum was established in 2006 and houses art collector Sofus Olsen’s private collection of works by Faroese artists, which he has donated to the museum.

The youth association Virkið, which has its own meeting house, was founded in 1923. The sports association B71 shares sports facilities such as a football field with Sandoyar Meginskúli (Sandoy’s Central School). Sandur also has a kindergarten and a nursery.

One of Sandoy’s three old-age homes lies in Sandur, the second in Skálavík and the third in Skopun. The residents of the other municipalities have access to these institutions through a joint municipal agreement.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Skarvanes has nine inhabitants and covers 12 merkur; 1 mørk and 5 skinn are copyhold land leased by a copyhold tenant, and 10 merkur and 15 skinn are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 495 animals.

The settlement in Skarvanes can be traced back to the 16th century. The beach is characterised by being sugga, where driftwood, seaweed and other matter from the sea collect in large quantities.

The settlement has no church, and the school from 1935 is now closed.

With its many hours of sunshine, Skarvanes was one of the best areas for growing grain, and it had its own grain mill located in Mataráin, the stream from which water was drawn for cooking. Today, the mill is protected as a cultural monument.

The self-taught painter Díðrikur á Skarvanesi is one of the Faroe Islands’ first artists with his many bird drawings. Five of his paintings are still preserved and are exhibited at Listasavn Føroya in Tórshavn.

Skopun (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur View from the aft deck of the liner M/F Teistin across Skopunar Port. The ferry was a major advance for development on Sandoy and, together with the construction of the Gamlarætt ferry berth, it made the daily commute between Tórshavn and Sandoy possible. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 Skopun is a new settlement village established in 1833, which currently has 454 inhabitants. It is located in Sandur’s outfield and has no rights in the outfield or infield. The cultivated areas in and around the village have no markatal, but are cultivated plots of land.

The houses in the oldest part of the village stand close together and without any town plan, while the newer quarters are characterised by higher degree of planning.

The first road between two Faroese villages was built between Sandur and Skopun in 1917. The oldest harbour facility is from 1925, expanded in 1965 and again more recently. The village used to be connected to Tórshavn by boat, but in 1992, a car ferry service was established between Skopun and the newly established Gamlarætt ferry terminal at Kirkjubøur, from which there is also a connection to Hestur.

In Skopun, people have primarily lived by fishing; of the three former fish filleting factories on Sandoy, only the factory in Skopun remains. A change of ownership in 2019 has led to modernisations, and the factory now employs 60 people.

Føroya Grótvirki is the only masonry of its kind in the Faroe Islands because the basalt here is of a good quality and suitable for polishing. The masonry produces tiles and tombstones and is part of the international quality network ÉCONOMUSÉE.

The church in Skopun was built in 1897. It is made of stone with a corrugated iron roof, whitewashed on the outside and painted on the inside. It was rebuilt and expanded in 1961.

The Pentecostal Congregation and the Home Mission, both of which have many followers in Skopun, have their own meeting houses, both built in 1953.

The village’s first school was opened in 1884, and the current school was built in 1945 and has since been expanded several times, most recently around the year 2000. The school teaches the youngest classes, after which the pupils continue at the central school in Inni í Dal between Skopun and Sandur.

The dance hall, which was built by the youth organisation Samljóð in 1924, has the oldest theatre stage in the Faroe Islands. Until 1991, when the youth organisation built a new village hall, it was where much of the social life in the village took place. The old hall was taken over by the municipality and now serves as a local museum. Around 2015, the world’s largest mailbox was built next to the youth centre, which was supposed to receive letters for Santa Claus.

In the northern part of the village, a memorial by the sculptor Hanus Kamban was erected in 1954 to commemorate people who have perished at sea or in the mountains.

Politician Peter Mohr Dam, longtime leader of Javnadarflokkurin (the social democratic party), was born in Skopun.

KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 Skálavík, mentioned in Hundabrævið, covers 42 merkur, of which 16 merkur, 8 gyllin and 14 skinn are copyhold land, which is divided between two copyhold tenants, and 25 merkur, 7 gyllin and 6 skins are freehold land. The village has 145 inhabitants. The sheep herd consists of 1,885 animals.

Skálavík, with its scattered settlement, is a distinct agricultural village with a large infield, where the farm Dalsgarður has the largest infield in the Faroe Islands. The association Veltan also grows vegetables in Skálavík for sale and local consumption.

The church from 1891 was built of stone with a turf roof, which was renewed in 1957. In 1922, the church was the first in the Faroe Islands to have a pipe organ. Three reliefs carved by Tróndur Petersen, called Tróndur á Trøð, depict the apostles and Balaam with the ass.

The Keldan village hall is the setting of much of the social life in the village.

Shipowner and skipper Eiler Jacobsen, who grew up in Skálavík, built the Depilin centre in Skálavík in 2011. It has served as a hotel, but since 2020, it has housed a Christian continuation school.

P/F Bakkafrost is building a breeding station in Skálavík for researchbased breeding work with a view to making the Faroese salmon strain resistant to infection and disease. The facility, which will produce approx. 70 million salmon roe, is expected to be completed in 2025 and will create jobs in the area.

The writer Heðin Brú and the vicar and writer Kristian Osvald Viderø were both born in Skálavík, where their statues have been erected.

Skúvoy (Island)


trap.fo



	 	 The tombstone with the Latin cross called Sigmundarsteinur stands in the cemetery in Skúvoy. It is named after chieftain Sigmundur Brestisson, who, according to the Færeyingasaga, built the country’s first church in that place. SÍMUN V. ARGE, 2005 The three islands of Sandoy at 112.10 km², Skúvoy at 11.18 km² and Stóra Dímun at 2.65 km² include the markatal settlements of Sandur, Skálavík, Húsavík, Skarvanes, Dalur, Skúvoy and Stóra Dímun. Added to this, there is Skopun, an outlying village founded in 1833 on Sandur’s markatal land. These villages constitute Sandoyar Sýsla and the superior parish of Sandoyar Prestagjald.

The three islands constitute five independent municipalities: Skopunar Kommuna, Skálavíkar Kommuna, Sands Kommuna, Húsavíkar Kommuna, which includes Skarvanes and Dalur, and Skúvoyar Kommuna, which includes Stóra Dímun.

Skúvoy, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 33 inhabitants and covers 59 merkur and 12 gyllin. Of this area, 32 merkur and 4 gyllin are copyhold land, and 27 merkur and 8 gyllin are freehold land. The copyhold land is divided into five units, of which one copyhold tenant has leased the three. The sheep herd consists of 990 animals.

Skúvoy, together with Stóra Dímun, is one of the smallest municipalities. The village is known from the Færeyingasaga, according to which the chieftain Sigmundur Brestisson is said to have built the first church in the Faroe Islands. In the cemetery is Sigmundarsteinur, which is said to be Sigmundur’s tombstone.

Skúvoy, which is named after the bird skúgvur or skúvur (great skua, Stercorarius skua), is known for its rich bird life and the hunting of common guillemot and their eggs in particular.

The old church, which was built in 1852, was replaced in 1937 by a new one, designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð and built of concrete with a fibre cement roof.

In addition to the rich bird life, many people come to Skúvoy to visit Fagradal. This was where the woman Rannva reportedly served a life sentence for having given birth to a son out of wedlock, although the child was the result of a rape committed by a Danish lieutenant. In the background, Stóra Dímun and Lítla Dímun can be seen. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 There is a regular liner from Sandur to Skúvoy, and in the summer, many tourists visit the island.

	 	 Stóra Dímun is difficult to access, and especially in the winter, the residents rely on the regular helicopter service to and from the island. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 In addition to the rich bird life, many people come to Skúvoy to visit Fagradal. This was where the woman Rannva reportedly served a life sentence for having given birth to a son out of wedlock, although the child was the result of a rape committed by a Danish lieutenant. In the background, Stóra Dímun and Lítla Dímun can be seen. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 The three islands of Sandoy at 112.10 km², Skúvoy at 11.18 km² and Stóra Dímun at 2.65 km² include the markatal settlements of Sandur, Skálavík, Húsavík, Skarvanes, Dalur, Skúvoy and Stóra Dímun. Added to this, there is Skopun, an outlying village founded in 1833 on Sandur’s markatal land. These villages constitute Sandoyar Sýsla and the superior parish of Sandoyar Prestagjald.

The three islands constitute five independent municipalities: Skopunar Kommuna, Skálavíkar Kommuna, Sands Kommuna, Húsavíkar Kommuna, which includes Skarvanes and Dalur, and Skúvoyar Kommuna, which includes Stóra Dímun.

Stóra Dímun has ten inhabitants and covers 13 merkur copyhold land leased by a single copyhold tenant. The sheep herd consists of 450 animals.

Like Skúvoy, Stóra Dímun is known from the Færeyingasaga. On this inaccessible island is a farm where beets and a versatile selection of other vegetables are grown. Around 2020, a brew based on these beets, Mai, was launched, which can be bought in Faroese alcohol outlets. The island has its own authorised slaughterhouse, and a large part of the slaughtered sheep is sold as fresh meat to restaurants in Tórshavn.

On the island there is a school with accommodation for the itinerant teacher. In the summer, special tourist trips by boat or ship to Stóra Dímun are frequently organised, but there is also a regular helicopter connection to the island.

The legend of Annika í Dímun from the 16th century is linked to the island. She was married against her will to the farmer in Dímun, but she was sentenced to death and drowned in Havnarvág outside Tórshavn for killing her husband so that she could live with her servant.

Streymoy (Island)


trap.fo





Streymoy, northern part


The undersea tunnel, the Eysturoy Tunnel, was built in the period 2016‑1920 and is the Faroe Islands’ largest structure to date. It connects both sides of Skálafjørður on Eysturoy and Tórshavn on Streymoy. Tróndur Patursson created the artwork that was fitted around the tunnel’s roundabout. The chain of people holding each other’s hands gives associations to the traditional Faroese chain dance, but should, according to the artist, be understood as a broader portrait of Faroese unity as a prerequisite for the development of society. Eyðun Eliasen is the architect behind the portals and the light in the tunnel, which has several colours. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 At 374.9 km², Streymoy is the largest island in the Faroe Islands. On the west side of Norðurstreymoy, the northern part of Streymoy, lie the markatal settlements of Saksun, Vestmanna, Kvívík, Leynar and Skælingur and the outlying villages of Válur, Nes and Stykkið, and, on the east side lie Kollafjørður, Hósvík, Hvalvík, Streymnes, Haldórsvík and Tjørnuvík and the outlying villages of Langasandur and Nesvík.

Norðurstreymoy is part of the district Streymoyar sýsla and is divided into an eastern and a western superior parish. The area constituted one municipality until 1892. Vestmanna became an independent municipality in 1892, and other villages soon became independent municipalities as well. Norðurstreymoy now includes Vestmanna, Kvívíkar and Sunda Kommuna. For centuries, Kollafjørður has been considered part of Norðurstreymoy. It has now merged with Tórshavnar Kommuna. Sunda Kommuna includes villages on both Norðurstreymoy and Eysturoy.

Norðurstreymoy’s west side towards Vágar is grass covered towards the coast from Skælingur to somewhat north of Vestmanna, but then the landscape changes drastically to the northwest, where Vestmannabjørgini and Saksunarbjørgini rise vertically to several hundreds of metres. In the mountain gorges, the steep rock walls are interrupted by overhangs with many seabirds and large grassy skorar (rock ledges) where sheep graze in summer. You can sail into the gorges by boat.

The east side towards Sundini, the sound between Streymoy and Eysturoy, mainly consists of grassy moraine hills where the grass goes all the way down to the beach. Streams run down to the sea on both sides of Norðurstreymoy. You are never far from the sea in the Faroe Islands, but at Fjallið Lítla at Saksunardalur, the distance is the furthest at around 6 km.

The highest mountains north of Vestmanna are Koppenni at 789 m, Ørvisfellið at 783 m and Malaknúkur at 777 m; the 767-m high Skælingsfjall rises at the village of Skælingur, and southwest of Tjørnuvík you can see the Melin at 764 m.





Streymoy, southern part


The southern part of Streymoy includes the markatal settlements of Kaldbak, Hoyvík and Tórshavn with the new outlying village or suburb of Norðasta Horn on the western side and the outlying village of Hvítanes. On the western side, the region includes the markatal settlements of Norðradalur, Syðradalur, Velbastaður and Kirkjubøur. Together with Tórshavn, these villages constitute the capital municipality of Tórshavnar Kommuna, which also includes the islands of Nólsoy, Hestur and Koltur and village of Kollafjørður on Norðurstreymoy.

Far to the north on Streymoy’s western side, Saksun is surrounded by dramatic nature with steep bird cliffs and high mountain slopes. The written form Sakshøfn alludes to the fact that Saksun used to be a harbour which was filled with sand during a storm in 1602. The farmhouse Dúvugarðar with its outbuildings is protected and today belongs to Tjóðsavnið (the National Museum). ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018

Haldórsvík (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The octagonal church in Haldórsvík, the shape of which is unusual for the Faroe Islands, was built in 1856 on the initiative of the vicar C.V. Prytz. In his own draft for the church, he wrote that the church ‘should be built in a layout hitherto unknown in the Faroe Islands’. The model was the baroque church in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen. Due to financial problems, however, it was not fully completed according to plan until 1932. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 Haldórsvík, or simply Vík, covers 12 merkur. 4 merkur and 4 gyllin are copyhold land, which is distributed between four copyhold tenants, and 7 merkur and 12 gyllin are freehold land. The village has 109 inhabitants. The sheep herd consists of 792 animals.

The mountains around the settlement are high, and you can also encounter rock faces in the infield, which in some places are so sudden and steep that it has been necessary to establish terraces, called bríkar, in order to cultivate the land.

The village’s growth in recent times is linked to the development of the fishing industry. Port conditions in Haldórsvík improved in the 1970s, and a fish filleting factory was built in the port area. It created work for the population until it closed in the 1990s, and is now used to service the salmon farming industry in the area. The village still has a small port facility.

The octagonal church in Haldórsvík, which is very uncommon for the Faroe Islands, was built in 1856 with Frederiksberg Church in Copenhagen as a model. In 1996, the church had a new altarpiece painted by Torbjørn Olsen. The scene is The Last Supper with recognisable faces from the Faroese art world.

The village had its first school in 1904.

Hvalvík (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Hvalvík, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 248 inhabitants and covers 24 merkur. 14 merkur are copyhold land divided between two copyhold tenants, and 10 merkur are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 792 animals.

Hvalvík has grown together with Streymnes, and until 2005 they constituted an independent municipality, after which they became part of Sunda Kommuna.

The landscape around Hvalvík and Streymnes is both flat and hilly, and Stórá, which separates Hvalvík from Streymnes, drains off around half of the 12 km long Saksunardalur. The land is perfect for agriculture, and there are no bird cliffs and relatively far to the fishing grounds. Sea fishing became very important to the development of the village.

The church dates from 1829 and is one of the oldest wooden churches in the Faroe Islands. The building material partly came from the Scottish barque Broon, which ran aground in Saksun in 1828. The pulpit was originally made for the church in Tórshavn in 1609.

The school was built in 1962 by the local builder Jóannes Olsen. After the 7th grade, the children continue in the central school in Oyrarbakki.

P/F Norðsetur, which has manufactured model houses of various kinds since 1980, is one of the village’s largest workplaces. The village has a small port.

trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Hósvík has 340 inhabitants and covers 19 merkur of copyhold land distributed between four copyhold tenants. The sheep population consists of 486 animals.

The village, which is called Thorsvig in Danish, was apparently a pagan place of sacrifice. The originally small village began to grow at the same time as the sea fishing started and provided new opportunities for income. Hósvík was its own municipality until 2004 when it became part of Sunda Kommuna.

The church dates from 1929 and was designed by Einar Hansen and built in concrete. The first school was built in 1897 and has been expanded several times, most recently in 2008, and has capacity to teach grades 1‑3, after which the pupils continue in the municipality’s central school in Oyrarbakki.

Hósvíkar Róðrarfelag is the village’s rowing association.

There is a small port where the shipping company P/F Thor is headquartered.

Kaldbak (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur In 1971, chemical engineer A. Guttormur Djurhuus opened the company Marinplast in Kaldbak, which produced fibreglass products. The most important product was fiberglass boats based on traditional Faroese models. The first fýramannafør was built in 1972 and the first áttamannafør in 1974. Marinplast was closed down in 1992. The fiberglass boats, called Kaldbaks boats, became very popular and several of them are still in use. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2022 Kaldbak is located on the north side of Kaldbaksfjørður. It is a farming village with 252 inhabitants covering 40 merkur of copyhold land distributed between seven copyhold tenants. Of these, one has a farm in Kaldbaksbotnur. The village as one dairy farm, and the sheep herd consists of 976 animals.

The settlement is still scattered on several býlingar. Kaldbak was not connected by road until 1980, before that it could only be reached by sea. The road has resulted in new residential areas, where especially residents who work in Tórshavn have settled. The village has a jetty and marina.

The church is a traditional wooden church with turf roof built in 1835. The first school was built in 1911 and has since been expanded. It is today one of Tórshavnar Kommuna’s schools and offers teaching in the first grades, after which pupils continue in the larger schools in Tórshavn. There is also a day-care facility in the village.

In the period 1974‑92, the company Marinplast produced various products from fibreglass, the most important of which were boats in various sizes. The old workshop now houses the marine biology department of Tjóðsavnið (the Faroe Islands National Museum). A private project, Biofar, is also housed in the building. There are several salmon farms and other farming activities in Kaldbaksfjørður.

Kirkjubøur (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Kirkjubøur’s old white-painted parish church from the Middle Ages is protected from the sea by walls. Above the parish church is the old King’s yeoman’s farm, which was built on the old episcopal residence. The ruins of the Magnus Cathedral can be seen on the far right. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2019 Kirkjubøur has 88 inhabitants and covers 39 merkur of copyhold land, which is divided between four copyhold tenants; one of whom is native to the markatal settlement area in the village of Argir. The sheep herd consists of 702 animals.

From the village, you can see Kirkjubøhólmur, which was once connected to the mainland. It is said that during the violent storm called Kyndilsmessan harða on 2 February 1602, large, low-lying land areas were washed away and created the islet. This storm was also felt in Saksun. Furthermore, it is said that Sverri, who later became king of Norway under the name Sverre Sigurdsson, was born in Sverrishola, a rock cave above the village.

The old Catholic episcopal residence seat with a bishop’s palace called Ólavskirkjan or Mariakirkjan, which is the Faroe Islands’ oldest parish church, dates from the 13th century.

Kirkjubøur is an agricultural village where Gazet Patursson for many years also had a market garden with vegetables and plants, which were mainly sold in Tórshavn. The farmer, politician and poet Jóannes Patursson lived in the village, and so did his youngest son, the politician Erlendur Patursson, in his older years. The author and globetrotter Sigert Patursson, who in 1901 wrote the book Siberia Today, was born in Kirkjubøur. The artist Tróndur Patursson also lives here.

Today, the village is one of the Faroe Islands’ main tourist attractions.

Kollafjørður (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur From the head of the fjord Kollafjørðu, the landscape continues to the valley Kollfjarðardalur. The curved road leads from the opening of the Kaldbak tunnel to the roundabout. At the head of Kollafjørður is the neighbourhood Langasandur on the left with a quay and industrial area and on the other side is the neighbourhood of Oyrareinger, which has a cold store and transshipment of fish products. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2021 Kollafjørður, mentioned in Hundabrævið, covers 51 merkur of copyhold land and 1 mørk of freehold land. The copyhold land is divided between 11 copyhold tenants, one of which is the publicly owned research station Búnaðarstovan, which is located in the village. The sheep herd consists of 1,810 animals. Kollafjørður was an independent municipality between 1913 and 2001, when it merged with Tórshavnar Kommuna, and its proximity to Tórshavn means that many residents commute there to work. Others work as fishermen and sailors.

Kollafjørður, the Faroe Islands’ longest village, has for centuries consisted of 11 býlingar, which stretches along a several kilometre long settlement on both sides of the fjord: Sundini, Kjalnes, Miðgerði, Todnes, Hamrar, við Sjógv, Líðin, Langasandur, Oyrareingir, Signabøur, á Heyggi, frammi í Dal and frammi við Gjónna at Leynavatn, to which the inhabitants of Kollafjørður moved in 1815.

In 1801, Kollafjørður, with its 134 inhabitants, was one of the most important agricultural villages, and with a dairy farm with 45 dairy cows, agriculture is still important. The settlement currently has 818 inhabitants.

Tórshavn had to be reached by sea until a road was built across the mountain from Tórshavn to Kollafjørður in the 1960s. The connection was further improved with the Kaldbak Tunnel from Kaldbaksbotnur to Oyrareingir in Kollafjørður in 1992.

Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 The Kollafjørður fjord is a good natural harbour. In the southwest lies the 768-m high Skælingsfjall, and in the northwest lies Árnadalstindur at 722 m. In the long Kollafjarðardalur lie the two small lakes of Mjáuvøtn and the scenic Leynavatn, which has been known for centuries for its Arctic char, bleikjur (Salvelinus alpinus). Today, the lakes are a paradise for salmon. The restaurant KOKS, which received two Michelin stars in 2021, was housed in the old Frammi við Gjónna farm.

In recent times, the port facility at Langasandur and at Oyrareingir has been expanded. At Langasandur, there is a 460-m long quay, and the quay in the container port at Oyrareingir is 150 m long. There are also two marinas on Signabøur and in við Sjógv, where the local boating association is housed.

The village has a medical practice, village hall, mission house, free church and a house for the scouts’ association. It also has a nursing home for nine people. Preparations are underway for a new old-age and nursing home for 32 residents, which is expected to be completed in 2024.

In the port area, PP Faroe Pelagic, which processes pelagic fish for export, has set up a cold store, and the shipping company Samskip has set up two cold stores. Two shipping companies that own shrimp trawlers and trawlers equipped for pelagic fishing, A/S Líðin and Northwest Pelagic, are headquartered in Kollafjørður. The Kollafjørður fjord is approved as a salmon farming area where Bakkafrost holds the licence. Small-scale lobster fishing is also carried out in the fjord and off the fjord indlet in Tangafjørður.

The company Atlanticpane, which manufactures glass for construction, has established itself in the port area, just like Bulur, which builds detached houses, terraced houses, day-care facilities, etc. The transport company IR-transport has over 50 vehicles. There are also five other small companies with trucks and vehicles for special transports, as well as several small service and craftsman businesses.

The old thingstead is located in við Sjógv, and in the same area you can also find the Tinggarðurin from 1844, which has been preserved. The farm Sjóvargarður used to be a cultural centre where the poet and King’s yeoman Jens Christian Djurhuus lived. He composed several well-known ballads and songs such as the ballad Ormurin Langi, which is known and loved by everybody in the Faroe Islands. His great-grandchildren were the two poets J.H.O Djurhuus and H.A. Djurhuus.

The church in við Sjógv is a traditional wooden church with a turf roof from 1837, and there have been several churches before this one. The vicar lived in Kollafjørður on Kjalnes before he moved to Kvívík.

From around 1838 to 1849, an itinerant teacher taught the children in Kollafjørð. A permanent teacher was employed in the village in 1885, and the first school was completed in við Sjógv in 1889. In 1932, Oyrareingir had its own school designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð. Since 1970, all schooling has been gathered in Kollafjarðar Skúli við Sjógv designed by Niels Pauli Hansen with a gym and later also swimming pool. The school is now one of Tórshavnar Kommuna’s schools, and has pupils from the 1st to 9th grade. The school has access to a sports hall. Kollafjørður also has a day-care facility that can accommodate 80 children.

Since 1942, the village has had its own sports association, KÍF, which offers men’s and women’s handball, rowing and volleyball. KÍF has been Faroese champions in men’s handball and rowing on several occasions. The chess club Kollafjarðar Talvfelag, KT, was founded in 1966 and has won several championships.

Kvívík (Settlement) and Kvívíkar Municipality

	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The uncovered Viking Age house plots in Kvívík have been preserved as a monument of the past. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2010 Kvívík, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 403 inhabitants and covers 48 merkur, of which 22 merkur and 4 gyllin are copyhold land distributed between 12 copyhold tenants. 25 merkur and 10 gyllin are freehold land. The sheep population consists of 1,280 animals.

Kvívík and the markatal settlements of Leynar and Skælingur as well as the outlying villages of Stykkið, Válur and Nes by Vestmanna constitute Kvívíkar Kommuna.

People have lived in the settlement since the Viking Age as proven by the excavation of house ruins from Viking Age houses. In the mountains, there are traces of sentries and hiding places where people in the 17th century sought refuge from pirates when their ships were discovered off the coast.

From Kvívík, there is a short distance to the good fishing spots, but since the village is a brimpláss, the surf is frequent and heavy. However, the construction of seawalls around the small boat port has improved the conditions.

The current church was built in 1903 by builder P.C. Johannesen of hewn, plastered and whitewashed stone with a red roof of corrugated iron. The church was expanded and renovated in 1989‑90, at which point it was given a slate roof and a new church spire. The vicarage á Kirkjuteigi dates from 1852.

The village’s first school was built in 1907. A new school with gym and swimming pool was opened in 1976 and has since been extended. After the 7th grade, the pupils continue in Vestmanna Skúli. The school has included a kindergarten and after-school facility since 2016, which the municipality has decided should be free. The municipality has a green profile, and since 2020, a water mill has generated sufficient energy to heat the public buildings in the village.

The village hall, Glæman, serves as both a dance hall and a local amateur theatre. Rowing is a popular sport among the residents. Kvívíkar Kommuna’s central location on Streymoy means that the vast majority of residents commute to work outside the municipality, particularly to Tórshavn.





Viking age houses in Kvívík – Niðri á toft


During the construction of a house between the village and the coast in 1887, traces of an earlier settlement were found on the site. When the house was to be extended in 1941, new, even older finds were encountered, and the archaeologist Sverri Dahl started an excavation of the site in 1942.

The excavations uncovered Viking Age house plots dated to around the year 1000. They were ruins of two curved longhouses oriented north-south called skáli, which are also known from other excavations in the North Atlantic. The largest of the houses was closest to the stream and consisted of one 22 x 6 m room. The second was both shorter and narrower, and it was built together with other smaller houses with animal stalls and a barn. Such a separation of the stable from longhouse, which was a dwelling with a fireplace, was unusual for the Landnam period and may be from a later period.

Saksun (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Far to the north on Streymoy’s western side, Saksun is surrounded by dramatic nature with steep bird cliffs and high mountain slopes. The written form Sakshøfn alludes to the fact that Saksun used to be a harbour which was filled with sand during a storm in 1602. The farmhouse Dúvugarðar with its outbuildings is protected and today belongs to Tjóðsavnið (the National Museum). ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 Saksun covers 29 merkur and 8 gyllin, of which the 29 merkur are copyhold land and 8 gyllin are freehold land. The copyhold land is divided between four copyhold tenants. The village has ten inhabitants. The sheep herd consists of 818 animals. In 1584, Saksun was referred to as Saxhøfn. Saksun was one of the smallest municipalities in the Faroe Islands until it became part of Sunda Kommuna in 2005.

The village is surrounded by high mountains. To the south towers Streymoy’s highest mountain, Koppenni, at 789 m. At the opening of the valley towards the sea lies the wide sandy Lógvin beach, from which a narrow opening, Ósin, cuts into the land. In the Ósin, the stream follows the movements of the tides and opens into the pot-shaped Pollur. One of the large streams that flows into Pollur is Skipá. The village’s name may refer to the fact that there used to be a natural harbour here. It is said that, on 2 February 1602, the violent storm Kyndilsmessan harða filled the inlet with sand, so that the first ship that subsequently tried to call at the harbour ran aground on Lógvin.

The village is quite distinctive from other Faroese villages since the three old býlingar of Dúvugarður, Svartá and Kvíggjarhamar lie scattered and largely without any intermediate settlements. Saksun is a great place to fish for wild salmon both on the beach and in lake Saksunarvatn, which lie at the end of a 10 km long valley that stretches from Hvalvík to Saksun.

A Middle-Age church was closed after the Reformation, after which the inhabitants used the church in Tjørnuvík. In 1858, the church in Tjørnuvík was dismantled and rebuilt in stone with the former woodwork inside.

Saksun is among the Faroe Islands’ most visited tourist attractions because of the magnificent nature and the local museum in the old farmhouse Dúvugarðar, which has been preserved with its original interior.

Tinganes (District of Tórshavn)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur A petroglyph on Tinganes in Tórshavn. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 The fact that Tórshavn has been the administrative centre of the Faroe Islands since ancient times is also reflected in the old houses and in the preserved buildings, such as the many warehouse and commercial buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries on Tinganes.

When the bishop’s residence in Kirkjubøur was abolished in 1557, the vicar settled in Tórshavn. Around 1627, a new, four-wing vicarage was built on the ridge called Reyn on Tinganes. Today, only parts of the eastern wing, called Egholmshus, have been preserved. Archaeological investigations have shown that the south, east and west wings were built as half-timbered structures of Dutch bricks, and the floors were made of bricks laid in a herringbone pattern. The north wing was a dovetail log building.

From the courtyard, a narrow passage led directly into the town’s church, which, according to the sources, was built in 1609. This church was closed down in 1788, when a new one, Havnar Kirkja, was built north of the town. The official residence of the vicar in Tórshavn was a farm in the village of Syðradalur, from which he earned his income.

Portugálið on Tinganes. The inscription on the stone wall is ‘C5 1693’ and underneath ‘F.V. Gabel’. JOHANNES KLEIN/NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK, 1898 Today, the headquarters of the Faroese Government are located on Tinganes in Tórshavn, with the Prime Minister’s office at the far end of the headland. However, until 1856, the Royal Faroese Trade Monopoly was based in these historic buildings. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 Around 1580 a redoubt, á Ryggi, was established on the east side of Eystaruvág to protect Tórshavn. Recurring pirate attacks led to the establishment of another two redoubts. One was built in 1630 as a semicircular battery at the far end of Tinganes; the second was built in 1645 as a heavy rampart across the headland just north of the vicarage á Reyni. The largest redoubt was built on the rocky outcrop Stangarnes. It is still intact in its rebuilt form from 1790.

During a fire in 1673, the Gunpowder House, which belonged to the redoubts, exploded, and many of the buildings on Tinganes burned down. Archaeological investigations have since uncovered building remains and constructions from the time before the fire. These are basements of basalt boulders, where the older parts bear traces of skilp, which is a Faroese mortar with components of crushed shells and animal bones, as well as paved floors laid out in beautiful patterns, sometimes divided into smaller squares and dated to the first half of the 17th century.

On the remains of the redoubt at the far end of Tinganes, a warehouse, Skansapakkhúsið, was built in 1749, which later changed its appearance and is today the Prime Minister’s office.

The Munkastovan building stands out from the other 17th- and 18th-century wooden buildings, which rest on single-walled stone walls. The two-storey high building has 1.5 m thick walls with a binder of skilp. The closest masonry technical parallels can be found in the medieval stone buildings at the episcopal residence of Kirkjubøur. Munkastovan was originally longer than it appears now, as the masonry continues under the 18th-century building Leigubúðin, which is an extension of Munkastovan. It is possible that Munkastovan was linked to the medieval episcopal residence of Kirkjubøur either as a warehouse or for other ecclesiastical functions.

The archaeological material shows the importation of foreign groceries and household items of the same type as seen from the same period in other market towns in Scandinavia and Europe and produced in these countries.

In the rocks at the far end of Tinganes, a multitude of old petroglyphs, initials, house marks and years have been found, as well as a compass card, which are traces of sailors and traders. It is 16th and 18th century graffiti, which was common and also known from trading places in other countries.

Tjørnuvík (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Tjørnuvík on northernmost Streymoy is surrounded by high mountain slopes on three sides, but opens to the east and is a popular place for tourists. Despite the narrow roads, people flock to Tjørnuvík to experience the panoramic view with Risin and Kellingin in the centre. Tjørnuvík is one of the few places in the Faroe Islands where it is possible to surf. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2009 Tjørnuvík, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 46 inhabitants and covers 24 merkur. Of this, 4 merkur are copyhold land, which is leased on a single copyhold tenant, and 20 merkur are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 768 animals. The village was established in the Viking Age around the year 1000, which was documented during archaeological excavations in 1956. Here, among other things, they found a ring-headed pin which had belonged to an adult woman and is dated to around the 10th century.

Numerous large streams mark the mountainside after rainfall at Tjørnuvík. BJARNE JAKOBSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2013 Until the merger with Sunda Kommuna in 2005, Tjørnuvík and Haldórsvík were an independent municipality.

Tjørnuvík is a brimpláss with its sandy beach directly on the open sea. The village is surrounded by high mountains, several of which make for excellent bird cliffs towards the sea with scree at their base. The Sjeyndir valley extends at the northernmost part of the island. In the sea north of the villages, rises the 133-m high sea-stack Tjørnuvíksstakkur, on which rams graze in summer; you need to take a cableway to reach the sea-stack. The sandy beach in the village offers a clear view of the Risin and Kellingin rock formations on the other side of the fjord.

A stream runs through Tjørnuvík, which has provided easy access to drinking water, and there are still many traditional houses that have been allowed to remain almost untouched. The village was connected by road in 1966, and since then it has been one of the country’s most visited tourist destinations.

In 1857, it was decided to move the church from Tjørnuvík to Saksun. For many years, the village therefore had no church and belonged to the church in the neighbouring village of Haldórsvík, to which the road was difficult. In 1937, Tjørnuvík had a church again, designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð.

A school was built in 1950, but it has since been closed down. Today, the building is administered by the Faroese artists’ association LISA, and artists can apply for a work residence in the building.

Tjørnuvík is known for having preserved the old, so-called Kingosang.

Tórshavn (Town)


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Section of Tórshavn in November 2021. The red buildings with turf roofs in the foreground are home to the Faroese government, landsstýri, on Tinganes, where the Løgting has had its seat for over 1,000 years. The Løgting is among the oldest parliaments in the world. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN Tórshavn has 13,628 inhabitants (2021) and has 21 merkur copyhold land. Until 1807, the village covered 8 merkur, after which 13 merkur in Álaker and Flatnahagi belonging to Kirkjubøur were assigned to the chief administrative officer. Of the 21 merkur, the 2, which are without outfield, belong to the old vicarage in Sandagerði. 8 merkur of outfields are leased by a copyhold tenant and the rest belong to Tórshavnar Kommuna. What characterises Tórshavn is the fact that most of the infield has been what is called trøð, or traðir in plural, for the last 200 years. Trøð, or traðir, is the part of the copyhold land granted to the inhabitants upon application, first as a lease and later as a purchase. The sheep herd consists of 140 animals.

Tórshavn, 2021. The port facility has been greatly expanded in recent years. The port now has several deep-water ports. A shipyard can be found in the western part, and south of the shipyard is the hospital. BASED ON UMHVØRVISSTOVAN The capital, Tórshavn, or Havn, has historically been and still is the centre of the Faroe Islands in all respects. Tórshavn gained the status of urban municipality in 1866 with its own municipal council. In 1978, Tórshavnar uttanbíggja Kommuna, which included the settlements of Hoyvík, Hvítanes, Argir, Syðradalur and Norðradalur, merged with Tórshavnar Kommuna, initially, however, without Argir, which continued as an independent municipality, until it also merged with Tórshavnar Kommuna in 1998. Since then, the municipalities Kirkjubøar and Velbastaður (2005), Kaldbak (1974), Kollafjørður (2001), Nólsoy (2005) and Hestur and Koltur (2005) have also merged with Tórshavnar Kommuna, which now includes all of southern Streymoy and with Kollafjørður, also a part of northern Streymoy. Today, Tórshavnar Kommuna borders Kvívíkar Kommuna and Sunda Kommuna.





The old Tórshavn


Tinganes is the old thingstead of the Faroe Islands. The headland separates the two bays of Eystaravág and Vestaravág. The Løgting was originally held out in the open on Tinganes, but eventually it was held indoors in a special Løgting House, which burned down in 1673. Until 1696, the meetings were held at the Reynagarður vicarage. The Løgting got a new house in 1696. When the old Løgting was abolished in 1814, the house was transferred to the judge of the Faroese Court of Justice who was now the sole judicial authority.

From the earliest times, Tórshavn has been the islands’ most important trading post, not least in the days of monopoly trading. Tórshavn was home to the Danish civil servants, the administrative officer, the judge of the Faroese Court of Justice, the commandant, the vicar, the trade manager and the barber, who in addition to being a barber also served as a doctor. The commandant was commander-in-chief of the Skansi redoubt and had about 30 soldiers under him. In the year 1600, Tórshavn had about 150 inhabitants, and in the year 1700 the number had increased to 330. Most of them were craftsmen, fishermen, day labourers and soldiers with their families.

The settlements on Tinganes were Heima í Havn and Úti í Havn. On the other side of the Havnará stream was the neighbourhood Á or undir Ryggi. The small urban community bordered the Húsagarður copyhold farm, whose farm and infield lay just outside the border of the town itself.

In addition to the small urban community, Tórshavn Parish has since the Reformation included the villages of Hoyvík, Syðradalur and Norðradalur. Later, Sandagerði, Álaker and Argir joined the parish. Until 1788, the parish church was in úti á Reyni on Tinganes. From 1709, the Royal Monopoly Trade helped to create stability in society in contrast to the outsourced monopoly to vassals of earlier times, but the monopoly trade was also an obstacle to business innovation.





The redoubts


The many pirates in the waters around the Faroe Islands also attacked Tórshavn. The redoubt at Stangarnestangi was built around 1580 by Magnus Heinason after a Scottish pirate attack, and it was greatly expanded in the decades after the Turkish attack in Hvalba in 1629 along with the Tinganes redoubt and Reyna redoubt. During the Scanian War 1675‑79, French warships plundered the town and destroyed all the redoubts. The Reyna redoubt was not rebuilt, while in the 1780s, the Stangarnes redoubt was greatly extended with bastions and equipped with several 18-pounder guns. The last pirate attack in Tórshavn took place in 1781. During the Napoleonic Wars, when Denmark supported France, the redoubt was destroyed by English warships.

The commander-in-chief at the Skansi redoubt was the commandant. Under him he had three corporals, three drummers and a garrison of 30 soldiers who had been enlisted from the various districts. They moved to Tórshavn, where they usually settled and started a family. The pay was low, but in the 1790s, the soldiers were allocated a piece of the outfield for their own use, Skansatrøðin with 37 small plots of land, one for each employee of the Skansi redoubt. The function of the redoubt gradually changed, and the soldiers became commandos. In 1865, the commando unit was transformed into a police corps, which had a guardroom at the Skansi redoubt, where there was also a prison. This police force was abolished in 1902.





Niels Ryberg’s trade


In 1766, the Danish merchant Niels Ryberg was granted permission to have a warehouse and a transit trade with goods from the tropical colonies that were to be shipped to Europe. The stock consisted of rum, jenever, wine, sugar, tobacco, tea, Chinese porcelain and various other luxury goods. The goods that did not follow the normal trade routes were smuggled to England. Up to 20 ships at a time could lay in Tórshavn’s roadstead at a time, ships that came to deliver or pick up goods. In the spirit of the times, Niels Ryberg also, unsuccessfully, tried his hand at herring fishing, cod fishing and production of dried cod. Changes in the world situation also changed the basis of this transit trade, and eventually it stopped.

For the population of Tórshavn, however, it was a time of prosperity. Vágsbotnshandilin, as the trade was also called, led to the construction of bridges, pavilion, shooting range, riding ground and a social club, which still exists under the name Havnar Klubbi. Ryberg’s business existed until 1788, after which it was acquired by the Copenhagen merchant Erik Eriksen, but activity steadily declined.

These 20 years were perceived by Tórshavn’s residents as cheerful and good times. The house Quillinsgarður still stands. Quillinsgarður was the home of one of Ryberg’s leading people, Quillin, who was a cooper and came from the Isle of Man.





Tórshavn grows


Production of dried cod slowly started in the last days of the monopoly trade and continued on a larger scale after the introduction of free trade in 1856. Fishing became the town’s main industry, especially after deep-sea fishing began in Tórshavn in 1872.

After the introduction of free trade, merchants, shipowners, skippers, officials, teachers and master craftsmen, along with the already existing Danish civil services left a new mark on the town. Many jobs were also created both on land and at sea, and this provided the conditions for a growing number of fishermen and workers. Industrialisation was also gaining ground. For Swedish capital, in 1886 an oil factory was built at Rættará in Tórshavn based on maritime oil. The factory building, which goes by the name Öström, still stands, but was closed down as a factory already in 1890, and the buildings were acquired by the merchant Jacob Lützen.

Today, the old factory contains the significant graphic workshop Steinprent with associated exhibition rooms and a shop with Faroese design as well as rooms for rent. The complex also includes the DIY warehouse P/F Valdemar Lützen, which today is one of the few major trading companies left on the waterfront.

The establishment of A/S Thorshavns Mælkeforsyning og Margarinefabrik, founded in 1908, became of great importance for the town. With its so-called milk boats operating regular services to surrounding villages, it not only supplied Tórshavn with milk, but also provided regular mail and passenger transport.

The German geologist Carl Küchler, who visited Tórshavn in 1912, was amazed at the shops’ large selection of goods, where ‘even a man accustomed to the mainland range could get value for money … Even in cigar shops and especially in confectioner’s shop’ nothing was missing.

The population increased continuously, and it became necessary to include more land for development. Around the year 1900, the municipality bought all the infield that belonged to the Vestari Húsagarður copyhold farm with a view to subdividing it for new roads and residential areas. The municipality had taken over the entire farm in 1922 and Álaker in 1930.

The fact that the municipality, together with public authorities, had control over most of the municipality’s area created room for manoeuvre, which has helped Tórshavn grow relatively easily – even today.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK The opportunities of self-sufficiency in the villages that agriculture provided did not exist for Tórshavn’s inhabitants, apart from fishing. In Tórshavn, the monopoly trade, and for 20 years also Rybergs Trade, were the largest employers. At the end of the 18th century, landless inhabitants were given the opportunity to rent a trøð (cultivated plot of land, smallholding), and from 1863 it was also possible to own the trøð by fulfilling certain conditions. The area was usually just large enough to grow enough grass for a cow’s winter feed, potatoes and vegetables and to keep sheep, goats and poultry.

Many smallholdings were established in Tórshavn, and they were given special names that can be found today as addresses in Tórshavn. Several inhabitants settled at the smallholding. The allocation of smallholdings to Tórshavn’s inhabitants was a clear social measure which continued in the crisis years of the 1930s. They gradually lost their importance as a means of living and for most people, they became a leisure activity that can be compared to Danish allotments.

As Tórshavn grew, the smallholdings became very valuable, as they were registered as private property and sold for large sums. Several of the old smallholdings have been densely built over, but some still remain as green enclaves in Tórshavn.





Tórshavn after World War II


Tórshavn, like the Faroe Islands in general, was marked by the British occupation during World War II. However, the town’s growth did not stagnate during these years, but continued at a steady pace.

During the British occupation of the Faroe Islands in 1940‑1945, the redoubt in Tórshavn became useful again, as the occupying power fortified it with new heavy coast defence artillery and anti-aircraft artillery. The redoubt is now protected as a historical monument, and the guns from World War II and earlier can still be seen.

Part of the old settlement úti á Reyni in old Tórshavn. The neighbourhood was actually supposed to be demolished, but was instead preserved and is today an attractive residential area. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 A new fishing port was built in 1954, and the new waterfront gave way to several new businesses related to fishing and shipping, such as a barrel factory, which was important to the herring fishery in the 1950s, an oil depot, a salt silo and an ice machine for cooling fish. The company Bacalao, which produced both dried cod and frozen fish fillets, became an important employer, but had to close when the economic crisis hit in 1992.

Tórshavn initially developed around the waterfront, but the expansion of the road network and car transport meant that the outskirts of town also became attractive for establishing companies. The port and waterfront developed into an area from which goods were shipped in containers to passenger ships and to the ferry connections to Nólsoy and Suðuroy.





Urban planning and the most important buildings


Tórshavn’s old municipal school today serves as Tórshavn’s town hall. In Vágsbotn, on the other side of the road, is the flight of steps that were built on the site where the restaurant Perlan used to be. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2018 Tórshavn is the country’s administrative centre, and the various public institutions create many jobs at all levels and in many different professional areas.

The residence of the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands, which was built as a chief administrative officer’s residence in 1880‑81, is very visible in the townscape. This small villa-style castle with a pyramidal spire is built of Faroese basalt according to drawings by H.C. Amberg, and the building is surrounded by a garden. The other state institutions blend in with the rest of the buildings, but they are all gathered in the neighbourhood around the residence of the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands.

When the Løgting was re-established as a county council in 1852, a new Løgting House was built, which was inaugurated in 1854. The house, which at the time was outside the town, was built of timber on a boulder base and with a turf roof and painted black. Since then, it has been expanded and rebuilt several times.

In 1921, Tórshavn’s city council arranged a competition to design the town arms. J. Waagstein’s proposal, Torshammer, won first prize and was chosen. STIG NØRHALD/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2016 In 1907, it was extended, given a new roof and cladding of corrugated iron and painted white. During a renovation in the period 1978‑80, the house regained its original appearance with cladding of black-painted woodwork and a turf roof. A proposal to build a completely new Løgting house in 1997 was shelved in 1999 after some discussion. The old house was kept as a chamber, and with an intermediate building, the house was merged with the former telephone switchboard for the Løgting’s administration, committee offices and common rooms. The Løgting House itself was now painted white again and got a slate roof. Prior to this, the Løgting had taken over the old pharmacy Tjaldurs Apotek in 1977 for its administration. Since 1997, the old pharmacy has been left to political parties.

The Løgting is an important part of the capital’s image, because every year on the day of the national festival ólavsøka on 29 July, the entire Løgting, together with the ministers and the country’s clergy, walk in a procession from the Løgting House to church service in Havnar Kirkja and back again.

When Home Rule was introduced in 1948, the Faroese Government was housed in the old buildings on Tinganes. The Faroese government acquired the entire complex of historic buildings in 1957, and they have since been renovated. When the space became too cramped, parts of the central administration moved to other premises in the towns in 1995.

In 2008, a plan was adopted for Tinganes, taking into account culturalhistorical, conservation and functional considerations. The Prime Minister’s office is on Tinganes and also contains the Faroese Government’s reception and meeting rooms. Varying ráð or ministries also have offices on Tinganes.

Tórshavn gained the status of urban municipality with a town council in 1866. It consisted of five elected representatives and the administrative officer as a permanent member. At that time, the right to vote was limited and the election was not secret. The administrative officer undoubtedly had a relatively large influence, because most meetings were held at his place. With the Municipal Act from 1908, all the members of the town council were elected by secret ballot, where everyone over a certain age was entitled to vote, including women. In the same year, Tórshavn was also given the status of market town.

From 1909, the town council meetings were held in the house Sloans Salur, which used to belong to the Brethren congregation. In the same year, the municipality bought Arnes Minde which used to belong to the shipowner and skipper Napoleon Andreassen. The house was designed by Niclas J. Niclasen á Bø, who had been a student at Vallekilde Højskole (Vallekilde Folk High School). However, the town council did not move in until 1918, and in 1926 the police were housed on the lower floor until a new police station was completed in 1967.

Tórshavn did not have an actual town hall until 1974 when the old municipal school from 1894 was converted for the purpose. The old parish hall above the town hall was converted into a spacious town council chamber in 1983.

Since 1866, the municipality has been responsible for town planning, building permits, the fire brigade and infrastructure as well as servicing in areas such as sewerage systems, refuse collection, care and schooling.

From 1867, the houses along the new Tinghúsvegur, the road in front of the Løgting House, were built according to a fixed building line. The lower, relatively large and fine houses had gardens in front, while the houses further up the street did not have gardens. The same order applied to the new quarter úti í Bø along the streets Tróndargøta and Magnus Heinasonargøta. Population growth and the lack of housing meant that for some periods, the urban planning was less successful. At some point, it was considered demolishing most of the buildings in old Tórshavn and replacing them with new ones, but this was stopped with the building regulations from 1972, under which the old Tórshavn was covered by special rules. As a result, this part of town has been preserved. The urban plan was revised in 1982 and a few times since, and the town has grown explosively in all directions with new suburbs. The increasing number of cars has also required the construction of both private and public parking spaces.

The municipal fire brigade Tórshavnar Sløkilið, which today covers all of the Faroe Island, has roots dating back to the Ryberg era. Today, the fire station is located at one of the town’s approach roads with a view of the town, while the town’s oldest fire station, Sproytuhúsið from 1822, can still be seen in úti á Reyni.

Tórshavn had its first modest water reservoir in 1866, a dam called Ovasti Dammur in the Havnará stream. Later, water pipes were established to water pumps in the town, from which water could be tapped. Water pipes with running water were installed in the individual houses in 1898. Today, the town is supplied with drinking water from two large dammed water reservoirs with associated treatment plants in Havnardalur and Villingardalur, respectively. In addition, there are several smaller local facilities in the municipality’s other villages.

Former open waste sites in outfields and by the beach have long since been replaced by incineration plants. The first was built in Havnadalur in 1968 and closed again in 1987, when the new incineration plant Brennistøðin á Sandvíkarhjalla was built. The waste is now also sorted at the plant.

The municipality has become involved energy, and together with the energy company SEV, it has founded P/F Fjarhitafelagið with the aim of utilising excess heat from the incineration plant and from Sundsverkið, SEV’s power plant, for district heating. P/F Bakkafrost built the biogas plant FÖRKA at the incineration plant in 2020. It is designed to be able to receive 100,000 tonnes of organic material annually, and the excess energy is used for electricity production. In the outfield outside Tórshavn, a large wind farm has also been built that produces electricity, and an expansion of the park has been initiated.





Health and care


Dronning Alexandrines Hospital, built 1921‑23, was extended in 1962, and Landssjúkrahúsið, as it is called today, is still being expanded. With its 900 employees, it is the country’s largest hospital, and it collaborates with the two smaller hospitals in Klaksvík and Tvøroyri. Landssjúkrahúsið also collaborates with Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen and other Danish hospitals.

The chief medical officer in Tórshavn is a state institution under the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands. Tórshavnar Kommuna has 12 medical practices. The Faroe Islands’ central pharmacy, Tjaldurs Apotek, is located in the town.

The municipality has 14 daycare centres, and of these, one is located in the village of Velbastaður and two in Kollafjørður. Nine after-school facilities are distributed between the town and the villages in the municipality. In addition, Margarinfabrikkin, a former margarine factory, has been converted into an activity centre for children and young people aged three to 17.

Tórshavn’s first old-age home, Ellisheimið, opened in 1935. Since then, more have been added: Láargarður in 1987, Tjarnargarður, set up in the former naval station in 2004, Heimið við Vallalíð for people with dementia in 2005 and Boðanesheimið in 2012. Moreover, there are several senior co-housing facilities and respite care homes. Like the only orphanage, Føroya Barnaheim, established in 1936, the nursing home Hvíldarheimið Naina from the same year, accepts people from all over the Faroe Islands.





Churches and religious meeting houses


The eye-catching Vesturkirkja is one of the town’s landmarks. In the park outside the church is a statue of Sigmundur Brestisson, who, according to the Færeyingasaga, introduced Christianity to the Faroe Islands. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 The current Havnar Kirkja from 1788 was built a little outside the town and has been the Faroe Islands’ cathedral since 1990. It was rebuilt, expanded and renovated several times, and in 2016, the church was allocated the neighbouring house Arnes Minde for its other activities.

In 1974, another parish church was built in Tórshavn. It has 800 seats and was designed by designed by Holm & Grut. The shape is inspired by a ship with sails, and the 42 m high tower is shaped like a halved pyramid. Inside, the Jacob’s Ladder goes up into the church spire. In front of the church is a statue of Sigmundur Brestisson, made by the artist Hans Pauli Olsen and unveiled in 2006.

With its simple design both inside and outside, Argja Kirkja from 1978 combines a Christian meeting house and a church that was built by the local congregation.

Hoyvíkar Kirkja with about 600 seats was inaugurated in 2007 and was designed by Albert Isfeldt & Gudmund Hansen.

The first Catholic church after the Reformation was Bauers Kirkja from 1860, named after the priest Bauer. The church was located at Rættará, but it was closed down relatively quickly. When the Catholic school Sankta Frans Skúli was built in 1930, a church was part of the complex. A modern Catholic church, designed by Árni Winther, was built in 1987. The mosaic at the entrance was done by the Danish artist Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen, and the church’s stained glass windows were done by Tróndur Patursson.

The Seventh-day Adventists’ small church Bethel from 1930 was replaced in 1978 by a new church, built on the same land as the congregation’s private school from 1966.

In 1963, the Brethren congregation’s meeting house Ebenezer from 1905 gave way to the new Ebenezer, designed by J.P. Gregoriussen and Kristoffer Kristoffersen and built in concrete. The Brethren congregation also has meeting houses elsewhere in the municipality. A branch of the Brethren congregation Lívdin inaugurated an meeting house or cultural centre in Hoyvík in 2021, designed by SNA Arkitekter.

The Pentecostal congregation has two meeting houses in Tórshavn, City Church and Filadelfia, as well as meeting houses in other villages in the municipality. The Salvation Army has its meeting room in the centre of Tórshavn, and the congregation Oasan í Hoyvík is a free church founded on Lutheran land in 2002. Jehovah’s Witnesses have a Kingdom Hall in Tórshavn.





Cemeteries


The oldest, long since abandoned cemetery was at Tinganes. In 1782, Kirkjugarðurin við Landavegin, also called The Old Cemetery, was established outside the town á Svínaryggi and expanded in 1922. A smaller cemetery was also built around Havnar Kirkja in 1788, but no one has been buried there for the last 150 years.

Established in 1935, Kirkjugarðurin við Velbastaðvegin has been expanded several times. The cemetery has a section with British soldiers’ graves from World War II. In 1951, a chapel was built, designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð.

The newest cemetery in Tórshavnar Kommuna is the cemetery in Hoyvík, which was inaugurated on 28 August 2019.





Schools and educational institutions


Norðurlandahúsið í Føroyum (the Nordic House) with its distinctive turf roof is one of the most important cultural institutions in the Faroe Islands. The house provides the framework for a wide range of cultural activities as well as meetings and professional congresses. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2021 The old grammar school was formally closed in 1804, and the school, Almueskolen, from 1632 was taken over by the Faroe County School Board in 1824. The middle and secondary school, Færøernes Mellem- og Realskole, was established in 1861 as an independent school. In 1916, the building was taken over by the bookshop H.N. Jacobsens Bókahandil when the school moved to new buildings further up town.

A municipal school was built in basalt by Faroese craftsmen in 1894. It was in use until 1956, when a new, larger school, built by Lamhauge & Waagstein, was commissioned. It was next door to the middle and secondary school, which became an integrated part of the municipal school in 1962. Today, the buildings house the Finsen hall of residence, named after the Nobel laureate Niels R. Finsen, who was from Tórshavn.

The Catholic school, Sankta Frans Skúli, designed by H.C.W. Tórgarð and built in 1930, was taken over by the municipality in 1985.

In 1968, the practice school Venjingarskúlin was built in the same complex as the teachers’ school, Føroya Læraraskúli. Another large primary school, Eysturskúlin, was inaugurated in 1980.

Population growth and the expansion of the town with several new residential areas have resulted in the closure of schools and the construction of new ones elsewhere in the municipality. The biggest new school is Skúlin á Fløtum from 2020. Of the older schools in Tórshavn, only Eysturskúlin and Sankta Frans Skúli remain. In Argir, the rapidly growing suburb of Tórshavn, Skúlin á Argjahamri was inaugurated in 2011. Hoyvík has a school from 1977 which has been expanded a few times, and Hoyvík Skúlin við Løgmannabreyt which was completed in 2008.

There are two private independent schools in the municipality. One, Lítliskúli við Hoyvíkstjørn, has rented the Adventists’ former school building, and Tórshavnar Frískúli is located in the village of Velbastaður.

The Skúlin á Trøðni special school was established in 1962 as a Danish institution under the name Statens Skole for Høre- og Talelidende (the state school for hearing and speechhandicapped pupils). It has since been taken over by the Faroese authorities and is today the only special school for pupils with special needs. The Sernám institution is housed in the same building. It offers nationwide consultancy to schools, daycare centres and parents on special education in collaboration with the municipalities.

Tórshavn is home to the country’s largest and most important educational institutions at both youth and higher education levels. These include Glasir – Tórshavn College, which is home to a high school, higher preparatory examination course (HF), technical college and business college. The town is also home to the teachers’ school, which was established in 1870 and merged with the university in 2008.

Following the initiative of the scientific society Føroya Fróðskaparfelag, Føroya Fróðskaparsetur, with the subtitle Academia Færoensis, was established in 1965, and in 1967, it moved into a modest building. In 1987, Føroya Fróðskaparsetur was given the status of a university, and today it is an important part of the town, especially after residence halls for the students have also been built.





Folk high school and leisure-time education


The folk high school, Føroya Fólkaháskúli, moved from the deserted area of Føgrulíð on Borðoy to Tórshavn in 1909, where it has been ever since. A stay at a folk high school was the first step for many who wanted to pursue further education. Today, the folk high school mostly teaches creative subjects and organises various courses.

Tórshavnar Musikskúli, the local music school, moved into a contemporary building, the Hátún concert hall, in 2020.

Tórshavn has offered evening classes since 1882. This type of leisure- time education is currently provided by Tórshavnar kvøld-, ungdómsog listaskúli, Tórshavn’s evening, youth and art school, and the school offers a wide range of subjects, e.g. Faroese classes for immigrants.





Cultural and sports institutions


Vágsbotn at the head of Eystaravág is one of Tórshavn’s liveliest places with cafes, a fish and vegetable market and sale of various Faroese products, including homeknitted woollen products, such as jumpers and sweaters. FINN FRANDSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2021 Norðurlandahúsið (the Nordic House) was built in 1983 and belongs to the Nordic Council. It is the town’s most versatile cultural centre and is used for concerts, music festivals, theatre performances, art exhibitions, conferences, etc. The Nordic House also forms the setting for the New Year’s concert of the Faroese Symphony Orchestra, Føroya Symfoniorkestur. The house is next door to Kringvarp Føroya (Broadcasting Service of the Faroe Islands).

Sjónleikarhúsið, the theatre house from 1926, is owned by the amateur actors association Tórshavnar Sjónleikarafelag and since its construction, it has been home to both amateur theatre and professional productions. In 2005, Tjóðpallur Føroya was given the status of national theatre. It is housed in the old dairy premises of Thorshavns Mejeri og Mælkeforsyning, but plans are made to build a new national theatre in Tórshavn.

Previously, Sjónleikarhúsið, together with Havnar Bio, whose current building dates from 1962, were the two cinemas in the town. Of these, only Havnar Bio exists today.

Havnar Hornorkestur was established in 1901 (first under the name Hornorkestret Tjaldur) and Harmoniorkestrið GHM in 1922. These two bands are still active and visible in the townscape on special occasions. In 2014, the municipality had an old dry cleaner converted into the Reinsaríið venue as part of the plan to turn the Tórsgøta street into a cultural street for both young and old. There are several other music venues. At the waterfront in Vágsbotn, the music festival Voxbotn takes place every summer.

The Gundadalur area has formed the framework for sporting life in Tórshavn since 1909. Tórsvøllur, the town’s 6,040-seat stadium, was completed in 2021, but the pitch itself was in use before. In addition to Tórsvøllur, there are two other pitches and several sports halls. A large indoor swimming complex was built in 1982, and a new and larger one is under construction. Tórsbreyt, a modern running track, was built near Gundadalur in 2008. Several sports clubs have clubhouses in Gundadalur; the oldest football club is HB, Havnar Bóltfelag from 1904. Smaller sports facilities can be found in Argir and Hoyvík.





Public workplaces and private companies


What used to be a fishing port, fish factories and salt silo, are today home to research, teaching and various companies side by side with the still active shipyard MEST, which borders Tórshavn’s marina. In the middle is the Landsbókasavnið (the National Library of the Faroe Islands) and the old library, which is now the university’s administration building. On the left is the residential area Hornabøur with terraced houses built in the 1950s, and further up is Vinnuháskúlin which trains navigators and marine engineers. Vesturkirkjan can be seen in the upper left corner. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2021 With a few exceptions, the many institutions within the Faroese Government’s various ministerial areas are located in the capital, and together with the two large banks Bank Nordik and Betri Banki, they are some of the town’s major employers.

Most businesses and small shops as well as large and small companies were previously located in the town centre, but have now moved out to the industrial areas on the outskirts of the town with better space and parking facilities. The SMS shopping centre was built in 1977 under the same roof as the new pharmacy, Tjaldurs Apotek. SMS has been expanded several times, and the parking area includes a large underground car park. SMS has 25 different shops in addition to the Miklagarður supermarket, where the bakery Mylnan has a shop. The SMS group also includes the food chain Bónus, which has established several supermarkets in the town’s new outskirts with extensive new residential areas.

Føroya Keypsamtøka (Faroe Islands consumer cooperative) has a large store in the centre of Tórshavn and a large supermarket in Hoyvík. Several other grocery stores are connected to foreign retail chains, which supply the stores with goods, and are also located in the new residential areas.

In Tórshavn there are still two large wholesalers in the food industry: P/F Poul Hansen, established in 1927, including P/F Krás, and P/F Poul Michelsen, established in 1974, including P/F Kjøtbúðin. The major Faroese player in milk and milk production is MBM, Mjólkarvirki Búnaðarmanna in Hoyvík, which buys milk from the 18 dairy farmers. The Faroese International Shipping Register (FAS) is headquartered in Tórshavn, as are several shipping companies.

The liberalised alcohol legislation in 1992 has contributed to significant growth in the restaurant and hotel industry. This has proved favourable for tourism, which has grown considerably in recent years. Two new major hotels were opened in 2020 and other hotels have been expanded with several new rooms. Moreover, Tórshavn has smaller guesthouses, hostels and private accommodation. Tourism has also resulted in an increased number of busses and rental cars.

The public sector, the service sector and the liberal professions have grown a lot in the capital. Until the 1990s, the capital still had jobs in the fishing industry, but they no longer exist.

In the port area at Vestara Bryggja is Vónin P/F which develops and manufactures fishing gear and material for both deep-sea fishing and salmon farming as well as other equipment for offshore activities. This is also where the shipyard that began as Tórshavnar Skipasmiðja in 1936 and is now called MEST is located. The shipyard is owned by MEST Shipyard, which is the result of a merger in 2008 between the three shipyards Skála Skipasmiðja, Vestmanna Skipasmiðja and Tórshavnar Skipasmiðja. MEST, which stands for Machine, Electricity, Steel and Timber, has 250 employees and has been responsible for building the ship Jákup Sverri from 2020. At the other port area, Eystara Bryggja, is a terminal for arriving liners and the Norrøna car ferry.





Green areas and memorials


Since the end of the 19th century, several gardens with trees, such as maple and rowan, have been landscaped, and these are still part of the townscape. Attempts were made to plant spruce trees outside Tórshavn in the 1870s, but they did not grow.

Det Danske Hedeselskab (the Danish Heath Society) helped landscape Viðarlundin in 1904. Since then, the plantation has become Tórshavn’s urban park. There are also several green areas in the town, including Debesartrøð which has become a university park. In recent years, the municipality has built several footpaths in green areas inside the town and in the countryside around the town, where people can run or walk.

Several memorials have been erected in the urban space. Kongaminnið was erected in 1882 to commemorate the first royal visit to the Faroe Islands in 1874. A monument for the dean and linguist V.U. Hammershaimb can be seen in Debesartrøð. Under the tree crowns in front of the residence of the high commissioner of the Faroe Islands is a commemorative plaque for Niels R. Finsen, who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1903 for his invention of light therapy for skin tuberculosis. On the grass in front of Løgting House is a bust of the poet Rasmus Effersøe. Two small-scale statues of the poet brothers J.H.O. Djurhuus and H.A. Djurhuus have been erected in front of their childhood home at Áarstova, and at Sjónleikarhúsið, there is a fullsize statue of H.A. Djurhuus. In Viðarlundin is a statue of a sailor erected in 1956. It is an established tradition that every year on 1 November, the Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands lays a wreath in front of the statue in memory of Faroese sailors who have died at sea.

At Vágsbotnur, the western part of the port, is a statue of the sailor and national hero Nólsoyar-Páll made in 1995 by Hans Pauli Olsen. There are also several statues of a more symbolic nature such as Fiskakonan on Høgukei in Vestaruvág, Traðarmaðurin in front of the town hall, Myndin by the old savings bank and Bóndin and bóndakonan on Glaðsheyggur.





The waterfront


Tórshavn has always been the central port of the Faroe Islands, although it is not a good natural harbour. Goods and passengers were previously ferried ashore from the ships that lay in the roadstead. The arm crane at Vippan, where goods were unloaded, no longer exists, but the tread plank is still there. Jetties and berths were gradually built. Kongabrúgvin, the king’s bridge, was built for the king’s visit in 1874. The first pier and quay for large ships was completed in 1929, and in 1948‑54, the quay Eystara Bryggja on the east side of Eystaruvág was built. In 2020, the new port facility for large ships was completed and constitutes the Faroe Islands’ largest commercial port. To this should be added the commercial ports at Sund and in Kollafjørður, as well as several marinas in the municipality.

Many jobs at the waterfront related to fishing disappeared before the year 2000, e.g. Bacalao with its salt silo, and the demolition has made way for Sjóvinnuhúsið (the shipping house), which, despite its name, houses companies engaging in entrepreneurship, innovation and film production, as well as departments of Fróðskaparsetur Føroya (University of the Faroe Islands) and the restaurant Silo.

Today, most of the port area is closed to the capital’s population due to international agreements regarding the ports.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Ring from Velbastaður in gold-plated silver, decorated with the Christian symbols grapes and a cross. It was found in connection with the study of the village’s small church ruin with a round cemetery. The ring dates to the late Viking Age or early Middle Ages. FINNUR JUSTINUSSEN, 2016 Velbastaður covers 32 merkur of copyhold land distributed between seven copyhold tenants. The village, which has 242 inhabitants, is a distinct agricultural village with two dairy farms. The sheep herd consists of 830 animals.

Velbastaður shares a church and cemetery with Kirkjubøur, and the two villages formerly constituted one municipality. The village has grown considerably in recent years because many people who work elsewhere have settled here.

The Faroe Islands’ oldest existing youth organisation, Sólarmagn, founded in 1895, had its own assembly hall of the same name in 1951, which is shared by Velbastaður and Kirkjubøur.

The village had its first school in 1905 and a new one in 2000. The school offers classes for the youngest pupils and covers both Velbastaður and Kirkjubøur. The village also has the free school Tórshavnar Frískúli.

The Heilbrigdið treatment centre for people with alcohol and drug addiction opened in 1986.

Since 1992, the Gamlarætt ferry berth has been located between Kirkjubøur and Velbastaður. From here the ferries sail to Skopun and Hestur. The future undersea tunnel between Streymoy and Sandoy will also have its starting point here.

The singer and composer Teitur Lassen lives in Velbastaður.

Vestmanna (Settlement) and Vestmanna Municipality


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Vestmanna, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 1,248 inhabitants and covers 56 merkur. 34 merkur and 12 gyllin are copyhold land distributed between nine copyhold tenants. The freehold land covers 21 merkur and 4 gyllin. The sheep herd consists of 1,820 animals.

The hydropower plant in Vestmanna. In the area, electricity is also generated from wind and current and a planned pumped storage system. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2017 The outfield in Vestmanna is vast. In it lie the small lakes á Mýrunum, Frammi á Vatni and Gásavatn between Vestmanna and Saksun. Archaeological excavations have established that the oldest settlement is from the late Middle Ages. The village has since been divided into býlingar (neighbourhoods), which have now grown together.

The establishment of a branch of the royal monopoly trade in 1839 boosted the development of the village, which continued after the introduction of free trade in 1856. Shortly afterwards, several merchants established themselves as fish buyers, producers of dried cod and some also as shipowners and soon more fishing vessels arrived such as the Faroe Islands’ first trawler in 1906.

Population trends in Vestmanna 1966‑2021.

HAGSTOVA FØROYA The shipyard A/S Vestmanna Skipasmiðja was established in 1897. It was taken over by Tórshavnar Skipasmiðja in 1986 and is now part of the MEST Shipyard group. The company Vest Pack, established in 1984, makes packaging and other plastic items. There is also a fish factory and several smaller businesses, but many of the inhabitants work elsewhere.

The village is home to the Faroe Islands’ largest and most active book publisher, SPROTIN, founded in 1992. Until the undersea tunnel Vágatunnilin was inaugurated in 2002, Vestmanna was the hub for the car ferry service to the airport and to Vágar.

The village has had a church and a prayer house for centuries. The current church was built of hewn, plastered stone by builder Petur í Mattalág in 1895. Vestmanna had its first resident vicar in 1986.

The first school building was built in 1879. A new school with a gym and a swimming pool was built in 1950 based on drawings by Eyolfur á Heygum, and in 1955, a preparatory school was established here. The school was expanded in 1965‑66 by Lamhauge & Waagstein and again in 1986.

In 1988, it was decided to place a vocational fishing college, Fiskivinnskúlin, which should also have a high school programme, in Vestmanna. The school, today called Miðnám í Vestmanna, is part of the general highschool and vocational programme that also offers many specialised courses.

The old-age and nursing home, Heimi á Grønanesi, was completed in 2012. Within old-age care, Vestmanna Kommuna cooperates with Eiðis, Kvívíkar and Sunda Kommuna (the VEKS cooperation). The local museum Vestmanna Bygdasavn opened in 1985. Tourism is very important for the village, from which there are daily boat trips to Vestmannabjørgini, the bird cliffs north of Vestmanna, in summer. There are also boats that offer fishing trips for tourists, and there is a hotel and a large campsite.

The Danish-Faroese painter Jack Kampmann is buried in Vestmanna where he lived with his family and worked for many years.





Ólavur á Heygum and the power plant in Vestmanna


The King’s yeoman, merchant and politician Olav Johannes Olsen, called Ólavur á Heygum, was behind a large number of initiatives, such as the establishment of the Faroe Islands’ first telephone line in 1905 and the establishment of the bank Føroya Banki in 1906. He also had plans to utilise the water power in Vestmanna for a hydropower plant but met opposition, and the project was not realised during his lifetime. However, it became a reality when the intermunicipal company SEV was founded in 1946, and the first turbine started producing electricity in 1953 in Vestmanna’s power plant.





The gallows in Vestmanna


Vestmanna’s natural harbour is sheltered by Vágar and, like several other villages, it was plagued by pirates in the past, and there are several accounts of the inhabitants fleeing to hide in the mountains, which could interfere with the harvest work. Cattle, sheep and poultry were stolen, and church and property ravaged.

In the spring of 1615, the King’s envoy Jørgen Daa had been informed that Irish pirates were on their way to the Faroe Islands. On 22 May, he arrived with the two warships Jupiter and Vægter at Vestmanna, where two Irish pirate ships had been staying for several days. He successfully managed to overpower the pirates, and Jørgen Daa had a gallows erected where eight of the highest ranking pirates were hanged. He let the others go on one ship, while the other vessel was brought to Copenhagen as spoils of war.

In 1616, the pirates returned to tear down the gallows, as witnessed by four farmers. As a historical memory – and for the tourists – a gallows was set up on the site again in 2021.

Vestmanna, 2021. Up until 1860, virtually all buildings were up on the steep mountain slopes. The explanation is that it allowed people to spot pirate ships and hide more quickly in the mountainsides north of the village. Trade and fishing industry made people settle along the beach. The harbour has been significantly developed with a quay and marina. The facilities at the bottom right are owned by Kvívíkar kommuna.

Suðuroy (Island)


trap.fo



	 	Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 Suðuroy is 164.9 km² and the southernmost island of the Faroe Islands; it is 32 km long and 13 km at its widest point. The highest mountain on the island is Gluggarnir at 610 m. The coastal formations are irregular, and the west coast in particular is inaccessible with cliffs of considerable height. Beinisvørð at Sumba is 469 m. Apart from Fámjin and Sumba, which are on the west side, the other villages are on the east side by fjords and bays. There are several large and small islets around Suðuroy. Geologically, the island is interesting because of the deposits of available coal and several visible geological phenomena. All the villages on Suðuroy are today connected by roads and tunnels, and there is a regular car ferry connection between Tvøroyri and Tórshavn.

Cliff on the west side of Suðuroy where the lower part shows the Beinisvørð Formation and the upper part shows the Malinstindur Formation. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN/TRAP FAROE ISLANDS, 2021 Suðuroy forms one district, Suðuroyar, and there are seven municipalities: Hvalbiar, Tvøroyrar, Fámjins, Hovs, Porkeris, Vágs and Sumbiar Kommuna. A special dialect is spoken, which varies between villages.





The ‘turkish’ pirates


In the 17th century, the Faroe Islands were heavily plagued by recurring pirate attacks and Suðuroy was particularly vulnerable. Some of the pirates came from North Africa and, because the area was part of the Ottoman Empire, they were popularly called Turks.

In 1629, Hvalba was subjected to a particularly violent attack, in which six were killed and more than 30 people were abducted. Most of them were women and children, and they never returned. A strong storm caused one of the pirates’ ships to sink in Hvalbiarfjørður, and a large part of the crew drowned. The place where they were buried is therefore called Turkagravir.

The inhabitants of Suðuroy are also attributed with a particularly strong temperament, and this is believed to be due to the fact that the ‘Turkish’ pirates left behind other traces than just death and destruction.





The coal mines in Prestfjall


Already in the 17th century, Danish authorities tried to start the extraction of coal in the northern part of Suðuroy. The result was not great, but locally the coal became important as fuel in Hvalba.

During both World War I and World War II, when coal was in short supply, the exploitation of the deposits in Hvalba and Trongisvágur intensified. A small cargo ship now supplied all of the Faroe Islands, and this was one of the reasons why many places stopped using peat as fuel. Coal production reached its peak in 1958, when 12,000‑14,000 tonnes of coal were mined. Over 100 men worked in the coal mines, which were then the village’s largest employer.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Froðba covers 24 merkur, of which 3 merkur and 10 gyllin copyhold land divided between two copyhold tenants, and 20 merkur and 6 gyllin freehold land. The village has 272 inhabitants. The sheep herd consists of 1,120 animals.

The village still bears the distinctive marks of a traditional village with a large cultivated infield with significant, hobby sheep farming. It is located on the outer northern side of the entrance to Trongisvágsfjørður. At Froðbiarnípa is the rock Báradrangur, which sailors call The Praying Monk. The area has spectacular basalt formations, e.g. at the gorge Kulagjógv with fan-shaped stone columns.

Froðba has three old býlingar: á Hamri, á Bø and undir Skorum. The parish church and the entire parish cemetery were located in Úti á Bø (probably the original býling), where a runic stone was found in 1840. The newest church from 1840 was moved to Tvøroyri in 1856. In undir Skorum, there is a small jetty for small boats and a helipad.

The poet Poul F. Joensen lived all his adult life in Froðba, where there is also a bust in honour of him.

Fámjin (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The original of the first Faroese flag Merkið hangs in the church in Fámjin. ERIK CHRISTENSEN/CREATIVE COMMONS/WIKIMEDIA, 2009 Fámjin, referred to in Hundabrævið, covers 24 merkur, of which 2 merkur and 2 gyllin are copyhold land divided between three copyhold tenants, and 21 merkur and 11 gyllin are freehold land. The village has 86 inhabitants. The sheep herd consists of 1,120 animals.

The village is located on the west side of Suðuroy and is an independent municipality. A little further away is the lake Kirkjuvatn.

In the past, Fámjin has supposedly been called Vesturvík, and the origin of the name Fámjin is uncertain. However, legend has it that men from the village once robbed two women from a French ship, and the sailors were heard shouting femme mienne, ‘my woman’. This is therefore believed be the origin of the village name.

In Fámjin, the infield was replaced already in 1928, but here, as elsewhere on the island, agriculture play no significant role, apart from the hobby sheep farming. Most people work outside the village.

The old wooden church with a turf roof was built in 1826, and it was replaced in 1876 by a new stone church with a slate roof. The master builder was the Icelandic Guðbrandur Sigurðsson. In the church hangs the original of the first Faroese flag, Merkið, which was composed by Jens Oliver Lisberg and two other Faroese students. Jens Oliver Lisberg died in 1920 and is buried in Fámjin. In the church there is also a runic stone found in the village’s cemetery.

The village had its first school in 1886, and it was rebuilt in 1984. In 2021, there was only one pupil who was in the 6th grade.

There is a road to Fámjin crossing the mountain, and a bus company provides transport throughout the northern part of Suðuroy. A tunnel to the village is in the design phase, and the village has a small harbour to the west, allowing small boat fishing.

Hov (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Hov at Hovsfjørður, referred to in the Færeyingasaga, covers 24 merkur, of which 5 merkur and 8 gyllin are copyhold land divided between three copyhold tenants, and 18 merkur and 8 gyllin are freehold land. The village has 97 inhabitants. The sheep herd consists of 970 animals. The village has been an independent municipality since 1920. In the areas of school, daycare centres and elderly care, the municipality cooperates with the other municipalities on Suðuroy.

According to the Færeyingasaga, the chieftain Havgrímur established a farm in Hof; Hov is the Nordic term for a place of sacrifice. Archaeological evidence and place names, such as Ergidalur and Ergifossur, suggest that shieling was common in Hov in the Middle Ages, and excavations have shown ærgi (summer settlements) in Ergidalur near the village.

In addition to sheep farming and boat fishing, Hov has an old tradition of keeping many geese, and in the infield, it is still possible to see many of the distinctive goose houses.

Hov got its first church after the Reformation. The current church in the village is the old Vágs Kirkja. The village’s mission house was built in 1964.

The village’s first school was established in 1888. A new one was built in 1982, but has since been closed down and is now used as an activity centre, and the high school Miðnámsskúlin í Suðuroy uses the building for students with special needs. Heilsusskúli Føroya, offering social and health educational programmes, is also located in Hov.

Children living in Hov go to school in the neighbouring village of Porkeri. The old road across the mountain to Ørðavík is unsafe in winter, but unique basalt formations can be seen along the side of the road. In 2007, the tunnel between Ørðavík and Hov opened.

The first marina was built in 1935‑40 and is today mostly used by P/F Bakkafrost for salmon farming. As early as the 1950s, fish farming experiments were carried out, and there were facilities on land for trout and salmon production. P/F Bakkafrost took over Faroe Farming’s salmon farming in Hovsfjørður in 2016.

The local association of cultural history and archealogy has taken the initiative to restore a fiskastykki (stonepaved piece of land used for drying cod) and an old grocery shop that was in use until 1984 and which has now been converted into the museum Savnið á Myrini. The museum has a café and is used for a number of cultural activities, including an annual Viking festival and an animal festival. In 2016, it was decided to build a Viking ship and steps have also been taken to build a longhouse with a forge. In 2015, a stone was erected in memory of the Viking Age chief Havgrímur.

The Faroe Islands’ first qualified architect, Johan Hofgaard, was born in Hov.

Hvalba (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The old agricultural village of Hvalba or Hvalbøur, mentioned in Hundabrævið, is the Faroe Islands’ largest markatal settlement of 98 merkur and 13 gyllin. 41 mercury, 5 gyllin and 2 skinn are copyhold land divided between 28 copyhold tenants, and 57 merkur, 7 gyllin and 18 skinn are freehold land. The village has 599 inhabitants. Today, agriculture consists predominantly of hobby sheep farming, and neither Hvalba nor the other villages on Suðuroy have dairy cows. The sheep herd consists of 2,941 animals.

With its 202 inhabitants, Hvalba was the second largest village in 1801, surpassed only by Tórshavn. Together with the outlying village Sandvík, it became its own municipality in 1878.

The village is located on a narrow strip of land (eiði), from which there is access to the sea from both the east and west sides. It is surrounded by four mountains: Grímsfjall at 327 m to the west, Skálafjall at 374 m to the north, Prestfjall at 471 m to the southwest and the 514 m high Hvalbiarfjall to the southeast.

There was no road connection to Hvalba or Sandvík before 1963, when the Faroe Islands’ first tunnel was built between Tvøroyri and Hvalba and another between Hvalba and Sandvík in 1970. A new and contemporary tunnel between Hvalba and Tvøroyri was inaugurated in 2021.

Fishing has long been the main industry, and Hvalba got its first trawler in 1947. In the 1980s, another two trawlers arrived, Niels Pauli (1983) and Steintór (1985). Around the same period, a fish filleting factory was also established, which created many jobs, but the crisis of the 1990s hit hard and unemployment rose significantly. However, the situation gradually stabilised and the factory started up again.

During World War I, a small port facility was built in the district of Nes, undir Rananum. In the 1920s, two more port facilities, referred to as the small quay and the large quay respectively, were established at Bíargarður and Hamranes. The port was expanded and modernised in the 1980s in connection with the establishment of a fish factory.

The vicar of Suðuroy parish has lived in Hvalba for centuries. The current vicarage in Leirum was built in 1880 by the Icelandic master builder Guðbrandur Sigurðsson. The church was built in 1935 by master builder Jens Mortensen from Tvøroyri.

The village got its first school in 1882 and a new one in 1973, which was expanded in the 1980s. The school currently has some 100 pupils.

Hvalba, 2021. The village is believed to have been inhabited since the Viking Age and is for many Faroese synonymous with the coal industry. It reached its peak during and just after World War II, when ships from all over the country came to the village to buy coal. At that time, unemployment in Hvalba was almost non-existent but from the 1960s onwards, the coal industry began to lose its importance and the inhabitants therefore had to look for other jobs.

Lopra (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Located in Lopransfjørður, Lopra is an outlying village from 1834 and has 83 inhabitants today. The village had a whaling station, which was active in the period 1901‑53. Polar explorer Ejnar Mikkelsen was manager of the whaling station in the period 1928‑30.

Lopra has companies that collect and bottle spring water that seeps down the tunnel to Sumba. The water is sold in bottles under the names Kirvi and Aurora Water. Kirvi is the name of a mountain near the village, and it was the businessman Jákup Joensen, Jákup í Lopra, who instituted the bottling.

In 1957, Lopra and Akrar got the joint school á Leiti, which is now closed, and the children go to school in Sumba for the first seven years. The school á Leiti also served as a church and still does.

Both the road and the tunnel to Sumba start in Lopra. From the winding road, there is a beautiful view of the landscape and bird cliff. Lopra is within a short distance of Lopranseiðið on the west side, where the Dutch East India Company sailing ship Westerbeek ran aground and sank in September 1742, and 81 of the crew were saved.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Nes covers 11 merkur and 12 gyllin, of which 5 merkur and 8 gyllin are copyhold land leased by a single copyhold tenant, and 6 merkur and 4 gyllin are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 282 animals.

The village is located on the north side of the fjord mouth, and the short distance to the fishing grounds to the east was of great importance in earlier times.

Ruth Smith and her husband, the architect Poul Morell Nielsen, built their house in Nes, which was designed for her artistic activity. In the 1950s, the view of the sea inspired many of her paintings.

Porkeri (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Porkeri, mentioned in Hundabrævið, has 319 inhabitants and covers 37 merkur. Of this area, 14 merkur and 10 gyllin are copyhold land, including formerly endowed land, divided between eight copyhold tenants; 22 merkur and 6 gyllin are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 1,050 animals.

The name Porkeri suggests that pigs were kept in the area, and the it is also known for its good grain growing conditions back in time. What remains now is hobby-based ram farming, which has developed into a special culture with an annual ram show.

Fishing and navigation have played a major role in the village. The farmer Per í Gjørðum helped build the Faroe Islands’ first ship, Royndin Fríða, in Vágur in 1804. Already around the year 1900, there was a private navigation school in the village, where fishermen from all over the Faroe Islands came to train as skippers. The village had many active skippers, which is seen in the local architecture with a number of large and beautiful houses along the street Skiparavegur. The houses are known throughout the country as skipararekkjan í Porkeri (skippers’ street in Porkeri).

In 1961, A/S Kambur from Porkeri launched the first Faroese-built steel ship, Porkeningur, which was intended for longline fishing, from Tórshavnar Skipasmiðja.

Porkeri has had its own church since the Reformation. The current church, a traditional wooden church with a turf roof, dates from 1847.

The Brethren congregation has had a meeting hall called Betania since 1907. The current hall was inaugurated in 1975.

The village’s first school was established in 1888. The new one is from 1984 and has pupils from grades one to seven, after which they continue at Vágs Skúli. The old school is today a local museum with a restaurant. The old grocery shop, Skemmukrambúðin, has been restored with the help of volunteer work and support. In 2003, the municipality bought the furniture store Húsið við Á, which was converted into an activity centre. The neighbourhoods í Eystrum and í Skálanum, which date back to the 16th century, have also been restored.

In Porkeri, a small harbour with a pier was built in 1964, which has since been expanded several times, most recently in 1976. In 2020, SEV built a wind farm in the outfield.

Sandvík (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The outlying village of Sandvík was inhabited during the Landnam period. In the Færeyingasaga, it is told that Sigmundur Brestisson, after swimming the long way from Skúvo yto Sandvík together with his friend Thor, who perished on the way, ‘finally managed to drag himself ashore, where he was so exhausted that he could not walk, but crept up on the foreshore and lay down in the seaweed. The place where he lay is called Sigmundargjógv. Here he was beheaded with a hatchet by Thorgrim the Evil, who stole his fine clothes and the gold ring he was wearing.’

The village is surrounded by the two mountains Skálafjall and Borgin at 374 m and 430 m. In the period 1300‑1800, there were no inhabitants in Sandvík or Hvalvík, as the village was called. Around 1815, people from Hvalba settled in the village again. Sandvík got its first church in 1908, when the old church in Tvøroyri was taken down and moved here, and the first school was built in 1890. It was closed down in 2010, and today the children go to school in Hvalba. Sandvík currently has 71 inhabitants. A small port facility was built in the early 1900s. The author Martin Joensen was both born and buried in Sandvík. The vicar and Member of the Danish Parliament Johan Nielsen was also born here.





The Pilot Whale Accident


One of the greatest tragedies in connection with pilot whale hunt in the Faroe Islands happened in Sandvík on 13 February 1915. The weather was bad and during the hunt two boats capsized. The two crews totalled 15 men, and all but one drowned, ten from Hvalba and four from Sandvík.

This pilot whale hunt has since been referred to as Skaðagrindin (the pilot whale hunt accident).

Sumba (Settlement) and Sumbiar Municipality


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Contemporary colour scheme of neyst (boathouses) in the village of Sumba. Boathouse end walls have often been used as an expression in recent Faroese architecture. MARTIN N. JOHANSEN/BIOFOTO/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2018 Sumba has 252 inhabitants and covers 64 merkur. Of this area, 23 merkur is copyhold land soil and 41 merkur is freehold land. The land is divided between nine copyhold tenants. The sheep herd consists of 2,706 animals.

The villages of Sumba, Lopra, Akrar, Víkarbyrgi, Hamrabyrgi and Akraberg belong to Sumbiar Kommuna. The name Sumba has its origins in the Norse words suður, south, and bær, infield. In addition to sheep farming and fishing, bird hunting has also been very important. At 469 m, Beinisvørð is Suðuroy’s highest bird cliff.

Sumba has had a church since way back. The current one was built in 1877 in stone and concrete.

The village’s first school dates from 1889. It was rebuilt and expanded in 1965 and again in 2005. The children attend the first seven grades at the school and then continue at Vágs Skúli. Since 2005, the municipality has had its own day care scheme, while in the areas of schools, day care centres and elderly care, it cooperates with the other municipalities on Suðuroy.

The village’s inhabitants have a very distinctive dialect, and Sumba is known for its ballad tradition and traditional chain dance. There has been a road to Sumba for several years, and in 1997 a tunnel was inaugurated, making traffic to Sumba faster and safer.

The poet Poul F. Joensen was born in Sumba but lived most of his life in Froðba.





Dance, ballad and shrovetide


Men from Sumba dancing with some visiting dancers from other villages at Geilarfløtti in Sumba on Whit Monday, 24 May 1926. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK Sumba is known for having held on to its dance and ballad tradition. In 1976, the village’s dancing club was awarded the Europapreis für Volkskunst. The biggest event of the year is the legendary Shrovetide celebrations, and fellowtownspeople from near and far flock to Sumba to hit the cat out of the barrel and dance until dawn.

The ballad singer and dancer Hans Meinhard Djurhuus also wrote ballads, including Vigars Kvæði of 115 verses when he was 17 years old. The ballad is still popular among Faroese dancers

Trongisvágur (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur A cableway to transport coal from the Rangabotnur coal mines was built in 1934. The photo shows the cableway at the terminal at the port area at Drelnes, from where the coal could be transported further by sea. Photo from 1938‑40. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK Trongisvágur covers 24 merkur and 3 gyllin. Of these, 9 gyllin and 15 skinn are copyhold land leased by a single copyhold tenant, and 23 merkur, 9 gyllin and 15 skinn are freehold land. The village has 526 inhabitants. The sheep herd consists of 1,130 animals.

The village has three býlingar: í Húsgarði, í Syðrutoftum and í Svalbarði. In Catholic times, there was a house of prayer with a cemetery at Húsgarður.

Rangabotnur has coal deposits, and in the past, various foreign stakeholders were responsible for coal mining. However, it only became coherent from 1933, when the Danish-Faroese company P/F Føroya Kol took over mining operations. A cableway was built from the mines, initially to Trongisvágur in 1934, where plantations have now been established, and in 1938 to the new port facility at Drelnes in Ørðavíkarlíð.

The plantation in Trongisvágsdalur was established in the 1920s. Since then, more plantations have been established in the municipality. A new, large municipal school was built in Trongisvági in 1981, as well as a sports hall in 1982 and the football stadium Stadion við Stórá in 2012. The village also has a daycare centre. Since 1990, the consumer cooperative, Føroya Keypsamtøka (FK), has been housed in its own, newly built premises. Since 2021, Suðuroys Rúsdrekkasøla Landsins has had its alcohol outlet in the village.

A special tradition in Trongisvágur is the annual hare hunt.

Tvøroyrar Municipality


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 The villages of Froðba, Tvøroyri, Trongisvágur, Ørðavík and Ørðavíkslíð went under the municipality name Froðbiar Sóknar Kommuna until 1972, after which the municipality changed its name to Tvøroyrar Kommuna. The villages and neighbourhoods in the municipality, which used to be scattered, have today practically merged around the Trongisvágsfjørður fjord.

The oldest cemetery in the parish is located in Úti á Bø in Froðba, while the next cemetery from 1900 is in Ørðavíkslíð. In 1950, a new cemetery was built in undir Akurgerði.

A quay was built for shipping coal and salt at Drelnes in 1938. A ferry landing was built in the same place in 1988‑89. A jetty at Hvítanes was built in 1950, and two marinas were built in Heiðunum (1972) and Tvørabakka (around 1980).

The country’s first shipyard, Færøernes Ophalingsbedding, was established in 1894. Since then, there have been several smithies, boatbuilder’s yards, bakeries and confectioneries, shoemakers, watchmakers, bookbinders, barbers, hairdressers as well as margarine and milk supply, which for many years had its own boat, Sigmundur; in addition to collecting milk, it also served as a passenger ship for the villages on Suðuroy.

Tvøroyri (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The prefabricated church in Tvøroyri is located on a ridge and can be seen from most of the village. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2020 The outlying village of Tvøroyri emerged in 1836, when the first branch of the Royal Trade Monopoly was established on the sandy isthmus (oyri) at the outlet of Tvørá on the outfield of the Froðba markatal settlement. The village currently has 859 inhabitants.

In addition to an area for building plots, a trøð was also fenced off for the employees of the trade to cultivate for their own use. During the monopoly trading period, the establishment consisted of the factor’s and assistant’s living quarters, warehouses, lighter (wide and open ship), boat house, jetty and guest house from 1843 for customers who needed overnight accommodation.

Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 In the first years, population growth was insignificant. When Suðuroy got its first doctor in 1852, his official residence was in Tvøroyri, and the sheriff moved from Hvalba to Tvøroyri in 1854. The parish church moved from Froðba to Tvøroyri in 1856. The first post office outside Tórshavn was established in Tvøroyri in 1884. Suðuroy Várting (spring council) moved from Ørðavík to Tvøroyri in 1895. At the same time, a police station and prison were established. The first hospital was built in 1904 and was expanded in both 1953 and 1995. Føroya Banki opened a branch in 1922. The first pharmacy was established in 1931 and had new premises in 1964. A retirement home was built in the 1930s, and later the island’s Customs and Tax Administration (TAKS) and Almannaverkið (social security office) were added. Today, the headquarters of Strandferðslan (SSL), the Faroe Islands’ public transport administration, is in Tvøroyri, just as Føroya Tele on Suðuroy is also based in the town. In this way, Tvøroyri has developed into the administrative centre of the island.

Several merchants settled in the village after the abolition of the monopoly trade. When sea fishing using larger ships began in the 1870s, merchants also became shipowners. Fishermen and workers – both men and women – found work in the production of dried cod, and many settled in Tvøroyri.

The boom lasted until the early 1920s. The financial crisis in 1929 also led to bankruptcies and subsequent stagnation in the 1930s, and the trade unions in Tvøroyri took the initiative to establish cooperative enterprises: Ísvirkið in 1929 and AT in 1936. In 1953, a filleting factory was established which N.J. Mortensen A/S took over in the period 1955‑75. The cooperation Tvøroyrar Flakavirki built a new filleting factory at the port in 1975.

After the banking crisis in 1992 and the decline and reorganisation of the fishing industry under Føroya Fiskavirking, new players have emerged, including Delta Seafood, which has produced salted and frozen fish since 1995. Varðin Pelagic started in Tvøroyri in 2012 and has built large production facilities in Tvøroyri’s old port facilities.

After some simple and modestsize jetties, the country’s first actual concrete quay structure was built in Tvøroyri in 1924. It was extended in 1953 and a pier was added. During an extensive expansion of the entire port area in 2014, the quay facility was extended by 300 m to a deep-water port.

The old church was moved here from Froðba in 1856, and in 1908 it was again taken down and moved, this time to Sandvík. In the same year, Tvøroyri got a new large church that could accommodate 500‑600 people. The land was donated by churchwarden Daniel Mortensen, and the church itself was donated by A/S J. Mortensen Eftf. It was designed by Viggo Bertram and was prefabricated at Strømmen Trævarefabrik in Norway, from where it came as a construction kit of timber, later covered with iron sheets; the roof was also made of iron. The church rests on a solid foundation of basalt stone. In 1953, the choir windows were decorated with stained glass by Ernst Trier, except for the painting in the upper window, which was painted by the brother Holmer Trier in 1988. During a renovation in 1980, new wooden cladding was fitted and the church was repainted both outside and inside, and in 2017 it got a new steel roof. The church clock and church bells date from 1908. The church got a grand piano in 1980 and a new pipe organ from Marcussen & Søn with 18 stops in 1986. Baptismal font, altarpieces, church silver and chandeliers are gifts to the church, which has also received several votive offerings.

In the past, the villages in the parish each had their own school. In 1884, a school was established in Tvøroyri which served as a community school in the period 1884‑1905. It was expanded in 1915 and in 1927, lastly with S.J. Hofgaard as an architect. In 1958, a gym was established and in 1964 a swimming bath.

In Tvøroyri, as the first place outside Tórshavn, it became possible to take the middle-school examination in 1924, and the following year, it was also possible to take the qualifying examination. A technical college was established in 1932 and a business college in 1935. The latter two are the first colleges of their kind in the Faroe Islands. The municipal school’s last expansion was in 1974, when the higher preparatory examination (HF) were offered as a programme. More recently, a continuation school, afterschool facility and nursery and kindergarten have been established.

The first and oldest football club, Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag (TB), was founded as early as in 1892 and was for several years the country’s only football club. In 1900, a football pitch was built at Sevmýri, which is, however, no longer in use. Today, most sports take place in the new sports facilities and in the sports centre in Trongisvágur.

Tvøroyrar Hornorkestur (originally founded in 1904) plays at most major events on Suðuroy.

Tvøroyrar Bio opened in 1922 and was closed around 1990.

The politician and poet Rasmus Effersøe was born in Tvøroyri, and a memorial to his honour was erected at his birthplace in Heiðunum in 1957. The merchant and author Rich. B. Thomsen, who wrote novelsin Danish, was born and lived in Tvøroyri. Under the pseudonym Gretha Stevns, Eilif Mortansson, who was born and grew up in Tvøroyri, wrote the popular girls’ novels about Susy and Pernille.





From trading companies to worker cooporatives


Harbour area of Tvøroyri from about 1915. At the quay is a sloop and a so-called motor boat. Motorboats were built from 1905. The fishwives are washing and cleaning the salted cod to be dried. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK When free trade was introduced in 1856, the Danish merchant T.F. Thomsen bought the buildings and facilities of the Royal Monopoly in Tvøroyri and started his business. In 1858, T.F Thomsen had a competitor in Johan Mortensen, who also established himself as a merchant in Tvøroyri. He was born in Ørðavík and had previously worked at the Royal Monopoly’s branches in Klaksvík and Tvøroyri. The two merchants became involved in the production of dried cod and invested in fishing vessels. After the turn of the century, about 35 % of the Faroese fishing fleet, 40‑45 ships, belonged in Tvøroyri.

The merchants in Tvøroyri built up a collaboration with local merchants all over the Faroe Islands as goods suppliers and fish buyers. At some point, A/S J. Mortensen Eftf. had 31 fishing vessels, two freight steamers and some 30 branches (úthandlar) all over the Faroe Islands. They were also engaged in banking.

Fishing from ships and production of dried cod in Tvøroyri attracted lots of labour, and Tvøroyri grew explosively, as it allowed many people to create a future for themselves outside the old farming society on their own terms.

The merchant families and their employees constituted a small, powerful local bourgeoisie with a lifestyle that had parallels in similar environments in the Nordic region at the same time. They had big houses and their own club, Tvøroyrar Klubbi, where they could meet, while the workers and fishermen met at the dance venue Tvørátunga.

The weekly newspaper Føroyatíðindi was published by A/S Ásdal in the period 1915‑61, and Edward Mortensen (from 1923 Mitens) from Tvøroyri, who was a politician in favour of independence and a member of the Danish parliament, used the newspaper as a mouthpiece.

The large influx led to the creation of a special workers’ and fishermen’s neighbourhood, Valurin. The men organised themselves in the workers’ association Fylking (1915) and the women in the working women’s association, Fiskepigernes Fagforening (1922). The new Faroese Social Democratic Party gained many supporters in Tvøroyri, became represented in the municipal government in 1926 and won a majority and the office of mayor in 1935. When the party won two seats in the Løgting in 1928, one member of the Løgting, Peter Mohr Dam, was from Tvøroyri.

The economic downturn of the 1920s and 1930s, culminating in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, affected Tvøroyri and led to bankruptcies and stagnation. However, the local trade union movement took several business initiatives. Ísvirkið, a unique and modern cold store company, was established in 1929 with the aim of exporting fresh chilled and frozen fish as a supplement to the traditional dried cod. The company included a new freighter and nine fishing vessels. In addition to the world crisis, several concurring circumstances led to the bankruptcy of the company in 1932. The municipality took over Ísvirki’s building and facilities and rented it out. Fishing vessels, such as sloops and trawlers, came to Tvøroyri to buy ice to cool the fish. The synergies of this created fertile ground for other industries, such as the sale of coal, salt and later also oil.

J. Mortensen Eftf. went bankrupt in 1936. Subsequently, the company was acquired by the local trade union movement and was named Arbejdernes Trawlerdrift (AT), which ran a trading business and housed a consumer cooperative, shipping company and fish processing company. There was also a smaller shipyard, AT, which ceased operations in 1954. With its more than 400 employees, it was the second largest company in the Faroe Islands for some time.

In the period 1941‑71, Arbeiðaranna Kolavirki (AK) was responsible for the extraction of coal in the mines in Rangabotnur and had well over 100 employees at some point.

Tvøroyri, 2021. The turf-roofed Doktarahúsið from 1852 houses the Tvøroyri Museum. The renovation of the museum’s historic building on the port square, Pakkhus 18, is expected to be completed in 2024. The municipality has bought the remaining historic buildings. The historical archive opened in the same neighbourhood in 2018. Varðin Pelagic has large production units at the port.

Of this area, 16 merkur and 8 gyllin are copyhold land divided between eight copyhold tenants, and 33 merkur and 3 gyllin are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 1,722 animals.

Since 1907, Vágur has made up Vágs Kommuna together with Nes.

The village has access to the sea from two sides: To the west, the entrance goes through Vágsfjørður, and to the east at Vágseiði, smaller boats can be hauled ashore. On the west side are high cliffs and free-standing rock formations called drangar and stakkar, and in the northern part are semicircular valleys, called botnar, of varying depth. In one of these vallies is the lake Ryskivatn, from which pipelines were laid in 1921 to a hydropower plant in Botni, a valley further down. In 1967, for three weeks there were a series of earthquakes in the underground at Vágseiði, which measured 2 on the Richter scale.

Vágur originally consisted of the eight býlingar við Kráir, við Gjógvará, við Misá, í Smillum, á Oyri, á Skála, við Hvanndalsá and í Toftum.

Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 As Faroese maritime history has it, Poul Poulsen Nolsøe, Nólsoyar-Páll, built the first Faroese-built ship on the field Fløtuni Fríðu in Vágur, and the small schooner Royndin Fríða was launched on the 6th of August 1804. A memorial to the event was erected in 1962.

After the introduction of free trade in 1856, Vágur, like Tvøroyri, underwent rapid development. The first trading companies in the village were established as branches of other larger trading companies in Tórshavn and Tvøroyri, but they soon became independent companies. The largest were J. Mortensen á Marknoyri, Nap. Nolsøe á Marknoyri, Peter H. Dahl á Tjørn, Thomas J. Vilhelm (Tummas við Kráir), Jaspur Hjelm á Løðhamri, J.A. Godtfred (Hjá Diasi), A/S J. Dahl á Gørðum (Garðahandilin) and F/A D.J. Vilhelm við Misá. The ocean-going fishing vessel, the smack Johanna, which has been preserved and restored, was bought by A/S J. Dahl in 1894. Like Tvøroyri, Vágur became a centre for fishing and production of dried cod in the first half of the 20th century.

In Botni, northwest of the village, a hydropower plant was built in 1921, and in the same year Vágur became the first village to get electric light. The first quay facility was inaugurated in 1925 and extended in 1952. The port was further expanded in 1970 and again in 1976 with a fish factory. Since then, the port expansion has continued in order to accommodate more moored vessels, and landing stages and an industrial area have been established on the south side of the fjord. Parts of the port were upgraded to an oil terminal in 2012, allowing ships that required a depth of at least 10 m to access.

During World War II, a Loran-C navigation station was built in við Eggjarnar in Vágur. It was put into operation in 1943 and was administered by the British forces until 1946, after which it was taken over by Denmark until it was closed in 1977. Today, Við Eggjarnar is a popular tourist attraction offering a view of the bird cliffs on the west side of the island.

The crisis of the 1930s also led to bankruptcies and stagnation in Vágur. After a period of herring fishing in the 1950s, the filleting factory Suðurfisk was established in 1967 with Ove Mikkelsen as general manager. In 1977, Jákup Joensen, Jákup í Lopra, set up the filleting factory Polarfrost, the village’s largest employer in the 1970s and 1980s. Polarfrost had several trawlers.

The banking crisis of 1992 hit Vágur hard, and several businesses had to close, resulting in widespread unemployment. Since then, the local business community has taken many new initiatives. A new innovative company is Rock Trawl-doors. Since 2004, it has been manufacturing trawl doors based on the injector principle, invented by Helgi Larsen and managed by Hans Joensen, called Hans í Líðini. P/F Bakkafrost, which farms salmon in the area, has taken over Polarfrost’s buildings.

Around the turn of the millennium, the couple Karin and Árni Brattaberg founded the company Sirri, which produced yarn from Faroese wool for a number of years. This led to a revival of knitting and Faroese knit design, and the design company Guðrun & Guðrun was founded.

The current church, built in the period 1927‑39, was designed in Gothic style by the Faroe Islands’ first qualified architect, Johan Hofgaard, and built in concrete with an iron roof. In 1958, Ernst Trier from Vallekilde Højskole (Vallekilde Folk High School) decorated the choir with a stained glass window.

The village’s first school dates from 1875 and today serves as an exhibition room for art and cultural history. From 1933 to 1946, the village offered classes at middle-school and qualifying school level with examinations at Tvøroyrar Skúli. The new Vágs Skúli was inaugurated in 1951, and since, then it has been expanded with a swimming bath in 1975. Today, the school also has students from the villages of Hov, Nes, Agrar, Lopra and Sumba.

In the period 1974‑2013, it was possible to take the Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) in both Tvøroyri and Vágur; after that, all upper secondary education was centred in a newly built school in Hov. Since 2016, Vágur has had a sports academy with an adventure line. It accommodates a total of 48 students and is housed in the village’s old warehouses, but uses sports facilities both indoors and outdoors. In 2020, the housing company Bústaðir built a residential hall attached to the academy, accommodating 72 residents. One of the reasons why the academy is located in Vágur is the many sports facilities in the village, such as the multiarena Marghøllin with climbing walls and space for indoor football, handball and parkour. In addition, it is home to a football pitch and the local football club’s facilities, such as the VB Hall and the VB House. The Faroe Islands’ first 50 m indoor pool, the Páls Høll swimming complex, was built in 2015. It is named after Pál Joensen, who represented Denmark in swimming at the Olympic Games in 2012 and 2016. The complex is heated with waste heat from the nearby power plant. When the Faroese electricity company SEV won the Nordic Council Nature and Environment Prize in 2015, they donated DKK 350,000 to Páls Høll in recognition of this environmentally friendly heating method.

Marita S. Petersen, the first and so far only female Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands, was born in Vágur. The marine biology amateur researcher, author and cinema owner Jørgen M. Olsen also lived in the village.

Finally, the visual artist Ruth Smith must be mentioned. She too was born and raised in Vágur, where there is a museum dedicated to her works, the Ruth Smith Art Museum.

On a mainly voluntary basis, several initiatives have been taken to preserve the local cultural history. One of the initiatives is the smack Johanna TG 326 that has been restored and made ready for sea. It is used for leisure and tourist activities and has also taken part in several regattas both in the Faroe Islands and abroad. Ten old grindabáter (boats used for pilot whale hunt) have also been restored and made ready for sea: five boats with ten pairs of oars and five boats with eight pairs of oars, the oldest of which dates from 1873. The area’s traditions include a legendary New Year’s celebration with a torchlight procession and the burning of an old boat, attracting both locals and tourists.





The hydropower plant in Botni


The Faroe Islands’ first electricity producing hydropower plant was commissioned in 1921. The plant was municipal, and the Norwegian engineer Haakon Blaauw was in charge of the project, where pipelines were laid from the small lake Ryskivatn to the power plant in Botni. From 18 July 1921, there was electric light. In 1960, the plant was taken over by the intermunicipal company SEV. In 1982, a diesel engine power plant was added, the capacity of which was expanded in 2003 and 2016.





Ecclesiastical history of Vágur


An old legend tells that a Norwegian lady, whose husband had perished at sea, put an entire church, all dressed and ready to be put up, out to sea on a raft. The wish was for it to drift to a place where it was needed. Thus, the drifting Norwegian church became Vágur’s first, and the gift from the sea has since been a votive church.

The first Lutheran sermon in the Faroe Islands was given in 1538 in Vágur Kirkja by brother Andreas. The village has had a total of five churches. The fourth was built in á Kirkukletti in 1862. The builder was Guðbrandur Sigurðsson from Iceland, who lived in Vágur. In 1942, this church was taken down and rebuilt in Hov.

The churches in Vágur have had an organ since 1873. For the inauguration of the current church in 1939, Edith Dahl founded the choir Ljómur, the country’s oldest active church choir. The opera singer Rúni Brattaberg, who has since performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and Cincinnati Opera and in 2016 received the Faroe Islands Culture Award, was a young member of this choir.

The dean of the Faroe Islands during the period 1918‑44, Jacob Dahl, was born in Vágur. He translated The New Testament (1937) and the church rituals into Faroese, and he published a Faroese grammar in 1908. A statue of the dean, made by Janus Kamban, stands in front of the church.





Photographer Ellen Dahl


Herring net fishing at sea was at its peak in the 1950s and created many jobs until the filleting factories made their entry in the 1960s. In this photo, Ellen Dahl has documented the sorting of herring and how it is put into barrels in the port of Vágur in 1955. ELLEN DAHL Ellen Dahl (1907‑90), who was born and raised in Vágur, apprenticed as a photographer with Johan Harald G. Kaiser in Køge in Denmark 1924‑29, after which she returned home and set up her own photo studio in 1930. She took portraits, sold photographic equipment and developed photos for her customers and coloured pictures. Of greatest importance to posterity, however, is her detailed photographic documentation of life in the village, whose history has thus been systematically immortalised in pictures over a period of 60 years. She left behind about 150,000 photographs, glass plates and negatives, which her grandson, the photographer Rógvi Johansen, has digitised and made available to all interested parties.

Víkarbyrgi and Hamrabyrgi (Settlements)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Víkarbyrgi and Hamrabyrgi, on opposite sides of the Víkará waterway, had both a church and a cemetery. The villages were inhabited in ancient times, but were abandoned, only to be inhabited again later as an outlying village. A road connection came in 1977. From the beginning of the 1990s, salmon fry were produced in the place, but this has ceased. Today there are no permanent residents, only holiday homes.

It is said that the Black Death was the reason why the place was abandoned and that a woman called Sneppan í Hamrabyrgi was the only survivor.

	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Figure of Christ from the 16th or 17th century, found together with other archaeological objects at Krambatangi in Ørðavíkarlíð. The figure is kept in Tjóðsavnið in Hoyvík. SNR 0637, TJÓÐSAVNIÐ Ørðavík, referred to in Hundabrævið, is located on the southern side of Trongisvágsfjørður and reaches all the way to the head of the fjord via Ørðavíkarlíð. The sheep herd consists of 480 animals.

Ørðavík itself has 30 inhabitants and covers 12 merkur. 8 mercury and 10 gyllin are copyhold land divided between five copyhold tenants; 3 merkur and 6 gyllin are freehold land. Originally, the village had two býlingar: við Á and uppi á Bø. Although there are no dairy cows on Suðuroy, there is calf rearing facility in Ørðavík.

In Ørðavík at Tinggil uppi millum Stovur, the old thingstead of Suðuroy is found. The thing later assembled indoors in the farmhouse Uppi í Stovu in Ørðavík. Skarpheyggjar (derived from the Faroese word for executioner) and Gálgatangi are not far away, just like Tjaldavík, where people assembled spent the night in their tents. Outside this bay lies the uninhabited islet of Tjaldavíkshólmur.

At the old thingsted, traces of buildings have been found that indicate a seasonal trading post in a small natural harbour, Krambatangi. The name suggests that it was the activities of German or Dutch merchants. A number of objects were also found, e.g. a figure of Christ, believed to be from the 16th or 17th century.

In the Middle Ages, Ørðavík had a house of prayer, and in 1966 the village got a new one designed by Mortan Winther Poulsen.

In Ørðavíkarlíð, a cemetery was built around the year 1900. At Drelnes there is a port facility with an old salt silo, which today houses the municipality’s and the island’s cultural centre SALT. At Krambatangi there is a ferry landing for the ferry that operates between Tvøroyri and Tórshavn.





Veittrasteinur (Stone of The Spirits)


When the road between Ørðavík and Hov was built in 1959, there was a large stone in the middle of the planned roadway at the stretch within Tjaldavíkshólmur. The Danish road engineer wanted to blow up the stone with dynamite. However, the local road workers told him that the stone had always been respected there because it was supposed to be íbygdur: populated by supernatural beings who should be given peace so that they would not take revenge. The engineer was not superstitious and decided to blow up the rock. After repeated detonation attempts, with the fuse going out each time, the engineer finally gave up. The road was established around the stone in an S shape, and the stone is still there.

Svínoy (Island and Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Svínoy covers an area of 27.35 km² and is thus more than twice the size of Fugloy. The highest point on the island is Havnatindur, which is 586 m high. To the north, Svínoy is separated from Fugloy by Fugloyarfjørður, while to the west, the island is separated from Borðoy and Viðoy by Svínoyarfjørður.

The island’s only village, Svínoy, is mentioned as early as in Færeyingasaga from 1220. The village is located immediately north of the centre of the island facing Svínoyarvík to the east where there is a landing site. There is also a landing site with a small quay on the western side of the island. As on Fugloy, landing conditions can be difficult, especially in winter when the weather is bad.

In 2020, a previously decommissioned facility for salmon smolt farming was converted to farming lumpsucker, which is used in the salmon farms.

There is a ferry service to Svínoy from Hvannasund on Viðoy and to both villages on Fugloy. The island is also covered by a helicopter service.

Svínoy, which used to be its own municipality, was merged with Klaksvíkar Kommuna in 2009. In 1966, the population was 117, while it was 31 in 2020.





Svínoy settlement


The village of Svínoy has 31 inhabitants and covers 32 merkur and 4 gyllin. The copyhold land covers 14 merkur and 8 gyllin, and the freehold land covers 17 merkur and 12 gyllin. The copyhold land is divided between five copyhold tenants. The sheep herd consists of 997 animals.

Svínoy has had a church since 1592, maybe even earlier. The current church was built in 1878. The village had its first school building in 1880, but as of 2021 it had no pupils.

	 	 Viðoy covers an area of 41.01 km² and is the second largest island in Norðoyggjar. There are two villages on the island, Viðareiði in the northern part and Hvannasund in the southwestern part of the island.

The highest point on Viðoy is Villingadalsfjall north of Viðareiði, which at 841 m is the third highest mountain in the Faroe Islands. To the far north is the vertical cliff Enniberg, whose peak is 754 m above sea level In the middle of the island lies the characteristic pyramid-shaped Malinsfjall at 750 m.

Viðoy is divided into two municipalities, Viðareiðis Kommuna and Hvannasunds Kommuna. Hvannasunds Kommuna also includes villages on Borðoy on the other side of the sound.

From ancient times, the vicarage on Norðoyggjar has been located in Ónagerði in Viðareiði. The current vicarage, built in 1854, is still the vicar’s residence. The church in Viðareiði, a stone’s throw from the vicarage, is built of stone and opened in 1892. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Norðdepil in the foreground and Hvannasund have been connected by a causeway since 1962, and the two villages are today part of the same municipality. A liner sails from Hvannasund to the islands of Fugloy and Svínoy. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2010 Hvannasund covers 16 merkur of copyhold land, which is divided between four copyhold tenants. The village is mentioned in the first Faroese land register from 1584. The sheep herd consists of 380 animals.

Since 1974, an embankment has linked Hvannasund with Norðdepil on Borðoy. Together with the villages of Norðdepil, Depil, Múli and Norðtoftir on the eastern side of Borðoy, Hvannasund constitutes Hvannasunds Kommuna. The protecting embankment across the sound has meant that it has been possible to build a modern port with port facilities on both sides of the sound, which has led to a lot of fishing-related businesses such as Bakkafrost.

Previously, Hvannasund and Norðdepil each had their own school, but Skúlin á Fossanesi, which was built in 1983 and expanded in 2009, is now a community school for the entire municipality with classes from 1st to 7th grade. Schooling continues in Klaksvík from the 8th grade. The school also has an after-school facility, and the village has an integrated day-care facility.

The number of inhabitants in the village of Hvannasund increased from 138 to 248 people in the period 1966‑2020.

Viðareiði (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur From ancient times, the vicarage on Norðoyggjar has been located in Ónagerði in Viðareiði. The current vicarage, built in 1854, is still the vicar’s residence. The church in Viðareiði, a stone’s throw from the vicarage, is built of stone and opened in 1892. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2016 Viðareiði, mentioned in Hundabrævið from 1350, covers 48 merkur. 44 merkur are copyhold land and 4 merkur are freehold land. The copyhold land is divided between eight copyhold tenants. The sheep herd consists of 1,163 animals.

Viðareiði is a typical village located by an eiði, i.e. on a narrow strip of land between two seas, with access to the water from both sides. The church and vicarage can be seen at the landing site on the right side of the photo. The previous unsafe road to the village was replaced by a tunnel in 2016. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN Viðareiði is an agricultural village with a dairy farm. The village has access to the sea from both sides of the island, but there is no natural harbour, and it is almost impossible to establish port facilities for modern fishing and business development in the fishing area. Since 1962, Viðareiði has therefore collaborated with Hvannasunds Kommuna on the port in Hvannasund.

Viðareiði was formerly the main village in Norðoyggjar, and in 1801, it had 94 inhabitants. The village has been an independent municipality since 1950, and the population increased from 202 to 352 in the period 1966‑2020.

Until 1934, Norðoyggjar was a superior parish with seven parish churches – from 1592, with a vicar who lived in the vicarage in Ónagerði in Viðareiði. Since 1934, when the superior parish was divided in two, the vicar of Viðareiði, has, in addition to the parish church in Viðareiði, only been in charge for the churches in Hattarvík, Kirkja and Svínoy. The current church was built in 1892.

When revivalist movements began to gain momentum in the Faroe Islands in the early 1900s, the first place it found support in Norðoyggjar was in Viðareiði. The Brethren congregation, which practiced adult baptism, already had a meeting hall in the village in 1906, and in 1907, the first person was rebaptised according to their teachings.

Viðareiði had its first school in 1895. A new school was built in 1986, with classes from 1st to 7th grade, after which the pupils continue their schooling in Klaksvík. In the school building, rooms have been set aside for a day-care facility for young children and an afterschool facility.

Viðareiði is connected to the rest of the Faroe Islands by road, bridge and tunnel to Hvannasund and Klaksvík. In 2016, the unsafe road to Viðareiði was replaced by the modern Viðareiðis Tunnel.

Hotel Norð in Viðareiði was renovated in 2019 and has a restaurant and meeting facilities.

Christian Matras, poet, professor of Nordic languages and, from 1965, the first professor at Fróðskaparsetur Føroya (University of the Faroe Islands), was born in the village.

Vágar (Island)


trap.fo



	 	The islands of Vágar and Mykines of 176.4 km² and 9.6 km², respectively, have for centuries constituted one district, Vága, and one superior parish. Today, the markatal settlements of Sørvágur, Bøur, Gásadalur and Mykines constitute one of the two municipalities on Vágar, Sørvágs Kommuna. The other, Vága Kommuna, consists of the markatal settlements of Sandavágur and Miðvágur as well as the relatively new outlying village of Vatnsoyrar and the now abandoned Slættanes.

Vágar is the third largest island in the Faroe Islands. Most of the coast is steep and inaccessible, but has bird cliffs and coastal formations such as Trøllkonufingur at Sandavágur, Trælanipan at Miðvágur and the islets of Tindhólmur, Gásaholmur and other sea-stacks at the entrance to the village of Sørvágur. Tindhólmur was supposedly formerly inhabited by a family; today, there are two holiday homes on the islet, one private and one shared by the landowners.

There are four lakes on Vágar: Sørvágsvatn, also called Leitisvatn, Fjallavatn, Hvilvtkinnavatn and Vatnsdalsvatn, of which the first two are the largest in the Faroe Islands. Sørvágsvatn runs off to the south over Bøsdalafossur, Fjallavatn to the north over Reipsáfossur.

The highest mountains on Vágar are Árnafjall at 722 m at Gásadalur as well as Malinstindur at 683 m and Reynsatindur at 677 m in Sandavágur.

The island’s three largest villages, Sørvágur, Miðvágur and Sandavágur, are located at three vágir (fjords) and all have sandy beaches. In Sandavágur, the landing conditions are more difficult than in the other two villages due to the surf.

In general, the population on Vágar and Mykines has been stable since 1966. It has increased in the large villages and in the centrally located smaller villages, but has decreased in remote villages such as Mykines and Gásadalur.





The occupation of Vágar and its aftermath


World War II and the British occupation generally had a great impact on the Faroe Islands in the form of increased desire for independence and subsequent political reforms, and it had very concrete and lasting consequences for Vágar.

Vágar was where the largest number of soldiers settled down, resulting in a major expansion of the road network on the island, and the small military airfield later became the country’s airport. Population increased significantly and a large number of jobs were created.





8000 British soldiers


The airfield in Sørvágur in October 1949. Hangar buildings can be seen in the background. After World War II, during which the airfield had been constructed by the British military, and until 1963, the airfield was used only sparingly. ERIK PETERSEN/RITZAU SCANPIX During the first years of World War II, British soldiers only came sporadically to Vágar, but after the 21st of March 1942, when it was decided to build an airfield on the island, the number increased considerably, and several residential houses and other buildings were seized. The port of Sørvágur was soon improved with a pier to more easily get heavy machinery and vehicles ashore. The entrance got modern entrance lights that were operated centrally. At the port, six large tanks were built to store oil and other fuel, which thus also became a German bombing target.

Smaller-scale cargo was unloaded in the port of Midvágur. The port had a bakery and a car workshop. In addition, there were warehouses and magazines for storing coal, foodstuffs, tobacco, spirits, sweets, uniforms and other personal equipment, spare parts and mechanical and electrical items.

Within a short time, military camps were also established. Around 350 barracks were built in the Uppi á Mýrum area of Sørvágur, making it the largest military camp in the Faroe Islands. The second largest at 150 barracks was in Vatnsoyrar and was called Lakeside. A number of smaller installations were also established on the island. The mess, toilets and showers were part of the camps’ common facilities. A modern sewage system with septic tanks was also installed. In addition, the British had their own electricity supply at a time when such a system did not otherwise exist on Vágar.

A hospital was established in Sandavágur, a prison was built in Sørvágur, a Catholic church was built in Vatnsoyrar and a cemetery was established in Miðvágur.

In addition to the soldiers’ residential barracks, there were also rooms for entertainment and recreation. The Entertainment Hut in Sørvágur had a theatre, cinema, dance floor and bar, and much the same was found at the Lakeside Theatre in Vatnsoyrar.

For a period, there were around 8,000 British soldiers on the island, which greatly affected the local community. For example, passports were issued to everyone on the island which had to be produced on request. The men were given limited access to British pubs; they were usually not invited to dances and entertainments, but the women were. The British ensured that famous actors and singers of the time, such as Vera Lynn, were flown in.

The soldiers’ main tasks were to build an airfield, roads, military installations and a seaplane station, which was very important in the beginning until the airfield was completed. At Bøur, there were two 12-pounder guns used for protection against sea attacks. At Chester Camp north of the lake Leitisvatn, there was an anti-aircraft battery with four guns, and at Giljanes between Miðvágur and Sandavágur they had two guns. In addition, camouflaged ammunition and bomb depots with communication and observation posts were located strategically across the island.

Quarries were built to obtain building material, and the large consumption of sand for concrete and concrete blocks affected the sandy beaches. Instead, paved roads and paths came to characterise the island of Vágar. The asphalt machine was located near the beach in Sørvágur. It was also in use after the war, when it was taken over by the municipality.





Vágar airport


The transit area of the small but modern and well-functioning Vágar Airport, which has been expanded several times since regular air service began in 1963. JENS CHRISTIAN TOP/RITZAU SCANPIX, 2017 The Faroe Islands’ only airport, Vágar Airport, is a result of World War II. At the beginning of the war, the lake Sørvágsvatn was used as an established landing place for the seaplanes, usually Sunderland float planes. The lake had moorings for the airplanes, and a concrete ramp was built where the airplanes could be hauled ashore and parked. It has been named Flúgvarabedingin (the plane slipway).

Of the three runways originally planned, only one was established. It had seven parking spaces for aircraft and a hangar. For many years, the hangar stood as a landmark but fell into disrepair and was later removed. The approach tower, which was built on a ridge so that it could be used for directing seaplanes and planes on the runway, has been preserved. Near the approach tower is the SOR (Sector Operation Room) building. The British’s most important communication centre in the Faroe Islands today houses the Føroya Krígssavn (the Faroe Islands War Museum) with memorabilia from World War II.

The airport was completed in 1943 and was in use until the end of the war. After the war, a brief attempt was made to maintain the air service using the small airplane Erla Kongsóttir, which, however, had an accident on the runway and had to be scrapped. After that, only a few Danish military machines used the runway, and all of the facility fell more or less into disrepair. It was not until 1963 that a private Faroese airline, Flogfelag Føroya, in collaboration with the Icelandic airline Icelandair, took the initiative for a regular air service between the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Denmark and Norway. Gradually, other companies, such as Maersk, came on board, and today the Faroese company Atlantic Airways (founded in 1987) and SAS provide the air service to and from the Faroe Islands.

In line with development, the runway and airport have been expanded and modernised several times, and traffic has grown steadily. With the establishment of the undersea tunnel between Vágar and Streymoy in 2002, it now takes 40 minutes by car or bus to and from Tórshavn.

Today, the airport is one of the most important employers on Vágar.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Bøur covers 18 merkur, of which 13 merkur and 4 gyllin are copyhold land, which is divided among four copyhold tenants, and 4 merkur and 12 gyllin are freehold land. The village has 75 inhabitants. The sheep herd consists of 496 animals.

The agricultural village of Bøur, which has easy access to the sea and fishing, lies on the northern side of Sørvágsfjørður. After the monopoly trade was abolished in 1856, Bøur immediately got a company that bought fish that was processed locally. A permanent road to Sørvágur was not established until 1953.

The village’s traditional church was built in 1865. The village’s first school was opened in 1916, but is now closed.

Gásadalur (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Gásadalur’s café and guest house, Gásadalsgarður, is a well-visited place, not least by the many tourists who make the trip through the tunnel to see the iconic Múlafossur waterfall. Before the construction of the tunnel, the village was extremely isolated as it could only be accessed by water or via a narrow footpath over the mountain. ÓLAVUR FREDERIKSEN, 2017 The markatal settlement of Gásadalur has 14 inhabitants and covers 18 merkur. Of these, 3 merkur and 8 gyllin are copyhold land, which is divided between two copyhold tenants, and 14 merkur and 8 gyllin are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 576 animals.

This small village was difficult to reach both by sea and by land until the tunnel to Gásadalur was opened in 2002, but the village has now become a popular tourist destination, especially the Múlafossur waterfall.

In Gásadalur, you can see the ruins of a farm complex that belonged to the fabled, wealthy woman Gæsa from Kirkjubøur. She had all her earthly possessions confiscated by the medieval church authorities because she had taken the liberty to eat meat during Lent. When she moved to Gásadalur, she was given 7 merkur of land by her sister’s son.

Around 1830, the outlying village of Víkar was established on the outskirts of the village, but the village was so difficult to reach and remote that the last inhabitants moved in 1910. Like Mykineshólmur, Víkar was a good grazing area for oxen and beef cattle.

For many years, the Faroese author and hymn writer Mikkkjal Dánialsson á Ryggi was an itinerant teacher in the villages of Gásadalur and Bøur.

Miðvágur (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Driving of pilot whales in Miðvágur in the early 1900s. With its large sandy beach, Miðvágur has been one of the best hvalvágir (recognised ports for pilot whale hunting) in the Faroe Islands, where the whales can landgongd (beach themselves). NATIONAL MUSEUM OF DENMARK, N.D. Miðvágur has 1,125 inhabitants and covers 48 merkur, of which 22 merkur, 14 gyllin and 17 skinn are copyhold land and 25 merkur, 1 gyllin and 3 skinn are freehold land. The copyhold land is divided between 16 copyhold tenants. The sheep herd consists of 1,598 animals.

Miðvágur’s outfield stretches right through Vágar, along the lakes of Sørvágsvatn/Leitisvatn and Fjallavatn. Munnin, the outlet of Fjallavatn, is the Faroe Islands’ second largest waterfall, Reipsáfossur. At the southern end of Sørvágsvatn/Leitisvatn lies the largest waterfall, Bøsdalafossur, and the cliff Trælanípan is a popular tourist destination.

The archaeological excavation at Tvørgarði in Miðvágur has been dated to the Middle Ages. It is a secondary farm, laid out from one of the village’s other viking farms. The original old thingstead on Vágar was located in the outfield at Miðvágur; it was later moved indoors at the Heimi í Stovu farm in the neighbourhood of á Ryggi. At the end of the 19th century, the village’s original six býlingar began to grow together, and new built-up areas were gradually added.

Population trends in Miðvágur 1966‑2021.

HAGSTOVA FØROYA Since Catholic times, Miðvágur has been a parish village with the island’s main church. Peder Ditlevsen Ahrboe and Beinta Broberg were a famous vicar couple in the old vicarage in Jansagerði, who have inspired the author Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen to write the character Barbara in the novel of the same name. The old vicar dower house in Kálvalíð is one of the Faroe Islands’ oldest preserved houses and now serves as a native museum.

The current church, which was completed in 1952, was designed by the local master carpenter Heini Joensen, who was trained in Bergen. It is built of concrete, inspired by the Art Nouveau movement and West Norwegian architecture.

The Home Mission and the Pentecostal Congregation each have their own meeting house in the village.

In 1961, after compulsory schooling had been extended from seven to ten years in 1959, the then Miðvágur Kommuna and Sandavágur Kommuna built a school together, which underwent extensive renovation in 2014. The school also has a sports hall.

In the latter half of the 19th century, the population began to grow, because more people gained access to parts of the outfield of the king’s and especially the vicar’s land, so that they could have a cow and otherwise support themselves by coastal fishing. In connection with the introduction of free trade, several traders arrived who bought fish from local fishermen. Along with the long-distance fishing and the greater number of ships that came to the village, it created the basis for a local production of dried cod.

For centuries, Miðvágur has been known as the Faroe Islands’ best hvalvágur, a whaling harbour for catching pilot whales, which had great economic importance for the island as a whole.

The first water-powered machine carpentry was established in the village in 1919. It manufactured windows, doors, stairs, etc. The current machine workshop, Oilwind – J.K. Joensen & Sonur, was established after World War II, and for many years it manufactured equipment for the Faroese fishing fleet, while at the same time experimenting with wind turbine production in the 1980s.

The first actual port facility with a pier was built in the 1920s, which was expanded in the late 1960s. At the same time, the Snarfrost filleting factory opened, which after being closed from 2010, now has new owners and has resumed operations. Hiddenfjord has salmon farming in the sea area off Sandavágur and Miðvágur.

Miðvágur was hard hit during World War II. The local trawler Nýggjaberg was torpedoed in March 1942, 16 crew members from the village died, leaving behind widows and fatherless children.

Miðvágur has a cemetery for British soldiers.

Several Faroese cultural figures were born in Miðvágur such as the linguist and folklorist Jens Christian Svabo, the poet Mikkjal Dánjalsson á Ryggi, the poet Olivar á Ryggi and the writer and folk high school alum Rasmus Rasmussen (Regin í Líð).

Miðvágur, 2021. Due to its central location on the island, the village has over time become home to several joint institutions, including vicarage, local thingstead, medical health centre and old-age home. The village originally consisted of six old districts which have gradually merged into a whole and later expanded. On the northern side of the bay is the port area with the fishing industry and on the southern side is the marina. At the head of the bay, there is a sandy beach with a sports area behind it.

	 	© Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Map of districts and municipalities. KF.FO AND PEDER DAM, 2022 Sandavágur has 973 inhabitants and covers 48 merkur. Of these, 2 merkur and 8 gyllin are copyhold land, which is distributed between six copyhold tenants, and 45 merkur and 8 gyllin are freehold land. The sheep herd consists of 2,222 animals.

From 1555 and until the old Løgting closed in 1816, the Steigargarður farm was the official residence of the lawman. It was here that V.U. Hammershaimb, vicar and founder of the Faroese written language, was born. A memorial has been erected in his honour in the village. He was the son of lawman Jørgen-Frantz Hammershaimb.

After free trade was introduced, Sandavágur developed like other places on the islands. As in the other two villages, merchants also became shipowners and invested in fishing vessels and trawlers. For many years, the largest and most wide-ranging company was J.E. Thomsen. Part of this old production environment has today been restored with a warehouse and surrounding stone-paved fiskastykkir where salted cod used to be dried. Today, the warehouse houses the café Fiskastykkið, which serves Faroese food made from local ingredients.

In addition to traditional sheep farming, Sandavágur had, until the summer of 2021, the island’s only farm with dairy production.

Sandavágur has a small marina and has now also been authorised as a hvalvágur, a place where pilot whales can be killed. That happened after conditions in Miðvágur worsened due to the expansion of the port.

The current church was built in 1917 based on drawings by Magnus Jacobsen, who was a master builder in Tórshavn, and is considered one of the most beautiful churches in the Faroe Islands. The altarpiece is painted by Lucie Ingemann, who was married to the vicar and poet B.S. Ingemann. The seven paintings on the choir wall inspired by the Catholic Way of the Cross are unusual in a Faroese context.

The municipality’s community school, Skúlin á Giljanesi, is located in this village.

From 1975 to 2008, there was a market garden and flower production with greenhouses. After 2008, the company reduced its activities and its premises were rented out for other purposes.

Salmon farming has become a very important industry in Sandavágur. Hiddenfjord has a breeding centre for salmon fry at Fútaklettur.

The tunnel connection between Vágar and Streymoy, which opened in 2002, has meant that more people have moved to the village and built houses there, but the newcomers generally work in other villages.





The Runic Stone of Sandavágur


In 1917, a runic stone was found at the abandoned settlement of Eingjartoftir with the inscription (translated into English): ‘Torkil Onundarson, an easterner from Rogaland, built this place first’. The stone is dated to the 13th century and is the longest runic inscription found in the Faroe Islands. Since then, Sandavágur has considered the Norwegian Torkil Onundarson from Rogaland in Norway to be the first to settle in the village.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur Sørvágur has 1,114 inhabitants and covers 48 merkur, of which 47 merkur and 8 gyllin are freehold land, and 8 gyllin are copyhold land leased by a single copyhold tenant. The sheep herd consists of 1,436 animals.

Population trends in Sørvágur 1966‑2021.

HAGSTOVA FØROYA Archaeological excavations have shown that there used to be a Viking farm in Sørvágur. In the old days, all land in Sørvágur belonged to the Norwegian noble family Benkenstok. In 1665, the land was taken over by a Danish buyer, who sold it to some Faroese, thereby making the land freehold land, with the exception of 8 gyllin, which was handed over to the king in 1729 because the owner travelled illegally from the Faroe Islands. Until 2007, this land belonged to the sheriff’s office on Vágar, but has now been leased to someone else.

After a storm destroyed the village’s old church, a new one was built in 1886, which is a modernised version of the traditional village churches. In 1973, the church was extended with a chapel and room for the vicar, and in 1986 it was repainted, and the architect Alan Havsteen-Mikkelsen was responsible for the colour scheme. In 2015, a separate building was built for the church’s social activities.

The Brethren congregation has the Kedron meeting house built in 1937. A new mission house, Libanon, replaced the old one of the same name in 1980, which now belongs to the local housewives’ association.

The first school building with two classrooms and a teacher’s residence was built in 1887. A new, larger school was built in 1957 and has since been extended several times. The old village school is now part of the local music school. From 1959, teaching was extended to also include teaching for the 10th grade. Since 2006, the village has had a nursery and a kindergarten.

After the introduction of free trade and the emergence of dried cod production, first coastal fishing and later also long-distance fishing gained great importance in Sørvágur, as in most other places, and several people were given trade permits. In 1953, the trading company P/F N. Niclasen was the first in the Faroe Islands to take the initiative to produce deep-frozen fish fillets, and after a short time, this turned into an industrial production. After the financial crisis in 1992, however, production was closed down, and subsequently the village started engaging in the now essential salmon farming industry and subsequent production of salmon products.

The country’s only airport, Vágar Airport, is located at Sørvágur. It was built during World War II and used by the British. It was not until 1963 that regular flights to and from the Faroe Islands were established.

Immediately after World War II, the village got a dance hall with a cinema, which, in 1969, was installed in a new complex near the village’s sports area and football field built on Dungasandur in 1954. The annual Country Festival has been held here since 2012.

A native museum was established in 1962 and today has its own exhibitions, in addition to the Føroya Krígssavn (the Faroe Islands War Museum).

Sørvágur, 2021. The village is located at the head of Sørvágsfjørður by a large sandy beach. The two rivers Kirkjuá and Stórá run through the village. The sports area is located adjacent to the beach. Between the sports area and the church is Oyran, a sandy area that is mainly used for growing potatoes. On the left side of the bay is the port area with boathouses, quays, marina and fishing industry as well as a forge within the actual port area.

	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The outlying village of Vatnsoyrar was established in 1921 in the outfield of Miðvágur where three families from Sørvágur settled. During World War II, the village was seized by the British, and the inhabitants had to move, but they returned after the war ended.

In 1967, the Brethren congregation had a building made for a camp school and activity centre, Zarepta, where many children and young people from all over the Faroe Islands come to stay. The complex offers many facilities and has been extended several times, most recently in 2016, when a new main building was built.

Vatnsoyra Snikkaravirki was established om 1968, which today is a modern window factory under the name Grant.

The village also has a well-run draper’s shop and a small vintage car museum. Vatnsoyrar currently has 42 inhabitants.

The village was first mentioned in 1463, but is considered to have been inhabited in the Viking Age, as evidenced by ruins in the village. In 1745, one of the village’s farms was destroyed by an avalanche.

The sheriff Samuel Michael Matras lived on the farm Uppistovufestið from 1813 until his death in 1857. He kept a detailed diary of all agricultural activities on the farm. The diary, which is kept at Tjóðskjalasavnið – however, a small part of it at the archive in Klaksvík – is a unique source of the country’s agricultural history.

Norðoyggjar (North Islands)


trap.fo



	 	Norðoyggjar (North Islands) is the northernmost archipelago in the Faroe Islands. The six islands Fugloy, Svínoy, Viðoy, Borðoy, Kunoy and Kalsoy, have from the old days been considered an administrative unit both in ecclesiastical and judicial contexts with its own vicar and its own local council. This is described in the Hundabrævið document from 1350 and in the registry of Skipan um Tingfaratoll from 1400 where Norðoyggjar is referred to as a unit. Today, the islands form one district, Norðoya, and are divided into two superior parishes.

With the Municipal Act of 1872, Norðoyggjar also became a municipal unit, which was gradually divided into several independent municipalities. In 2021, Norðoyggjar consisted of the five municipalities Klaksvíkar, Kunoyar, Viðareiðis, Hvannasunds and Fugloyar Kommuna.

On Norðoyggjar, as in the Faroe Islands in general, the peripheral agricultural villages have been challenged by both the centralisation of the fishing community and the emergence of the new tertiary professions in both the private and public sectors, and they have in many areas stagnated. Development and population growth have been centralised to the large areas with optimum port facilities and communication links. In recent times, salmon farming in the fjords and waters around the Faroe Islands has, however, created opportunities to establish and spread businesses and workplaces more evenly across the Faroe Islands.

A ferry crosses Fugloyarfjørður from Hvannasund on Viðoy to Svínoy and to both villages on Fugloy, as well as from Klaksvík to Kalsoy. All the other islands and villages on Norðoyggjar are connected by roads and tunnels. There is also a regular helicopter service to both Fugloy and Svínoy.





The spring council in Norðoyggjar


Since the earliest preserved Løgting records from 1615, the vártingið (spring council) in Norðoyggjar has been held in Vági (Klaksvík), but according to tradition, the council was originally held in Køtlum, a desolate plain in the mountains above Árnafjørður.

Køtlum is located roughly in the middle of Norðoyggjar, making the distance to the meetings at the council about the same for everyone. When in the 16th century, the civil servants in Tórshavn got a bigger role in the spring councils, they saw it as an advantage that the spring council was held in more easily accessible places. The spring councils were lower courts, and their judgments could be appealed to the Løgting in Tórshavn. This was held at ólavsøka on 29 July every year.

When the old Løgting was abolished in 1816 and the spring councils in 1852 and 1898, the judge of the Faroese Court of Justice took over the judicial duties.

Slættanes (Settlement)


trap.fo



	 	 © Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur The outlying village of Slættanes was established in 1835 with support from Faroe County. Newcomers were allocated some outfield for cultivation and a small amount of livestock to be able to sustain a living besides from fishing and bird catching. The areas that were gradually cultivated were traðir and had no rights in the surrounding outfield, which belonged to Sandavágur.

The population peaked in 1940: 74 inhabitants divided into 12 households. For a period, the village also had a grocery store, and the school also served as a church.

As the village had neither road connections nor electricity, the last family moved in 1964, and the remaining houses are now used as holiday homes.
